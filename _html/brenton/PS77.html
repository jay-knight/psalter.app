<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS77_5' data-id='PS77_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&#160;</span>And he raised up a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, to make it known to their children: </span>
<span class='v PS77_6' data-id='PS77_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&#160;</span>that another generation might know, even the sons which should be born; and they should arise and declare them to their children. </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS77_9' data-id='PS77_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&#160;</span>The children of Ephraim, bending and shooting <span class='add'>with</span> the bow, turned <span class='add'>back</span> in the day of battle. </span>
<span class='v PS77_10' data-id='PS77_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&#160;</span>They kept not the covenant of God, and would not walk in his law. </span>

<span class='v PS77_13' data-id='PS77_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&#160;</span>He clave the sea, and led them through: he made the waters to stand as <span class='add'>in</span> a bottle. </span>
<span class='v PS77_14' data-id='PS77_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&#160;</span>And he guided them with a cloud by day, and all the night with a light of fire. </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS77_17' data-id='PS77_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&#160;</span>And they sinned yet more against him; they provoked the Most High in the wilderness. </span>
<span class='v PS77_18' data-id='PS77_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&#160;</span>And they tempted God in their hearts, in asking meat for <span class='add'>the desire of</span> their souls. </span>
<span class='v PS77_19' data-id='PS77_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&#160;</span>They spoke also against God, and said, Will God be able to prepare a table in the wilderness? </span>
<span class='v PS77_20' data-id='PS77_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&#160;</span>Forasmuch as he smote the rock, and the waters flowed, and the torrents ran abundantly; will he be able also to give bread, or prepare a table for his people? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS77_21' data-id='PS77_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&#160;</span>Therefore the Lord heard, and was provoked: and fire was kindled in Jacob, and wrath went up against Israel. </span>
<span class='v PS77_22' data-id='PS77_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&#160;</span>Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation. </span>
<span class='v PS77_23' data-id='PS77_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&#160;</span>Yet he commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, </span>
<span class='v PS77_24' data-id='PS77_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&#160;</span>and rained upon them manna to eat, and gave them the bread of heaven. </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS77_26' data-id='PS77_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&#160;</span>He removed the south wind from heaven; and by his might he brought in the south-west wind. </span>
<span class='v PS77_27' data-id='PS77_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&#160;</span>And he rained upon them flesh like dust, and feathered birds like the sand of the seas. </span>
<span class='v PS77_28' data-id='PS77_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&#160;</span>And they fell into the midst of their camp, round about their tents. </span>
<span class='v PS77_29' data-id='PS77_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&#160;</span>So they ate, and were completely filled; and he gave them their desire. </span></div>

<span class='v PS77_30' data-id='PS77_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&#160;</span>They were not disappointed of their desire: <span class='add'>but</span> when their food was yet in their mouth, </span>
<span class='v PS77_31' data-id='PS77_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&#160;</span>then the indignation of God rose up against them, and slew the fattest of them, and overthrew the choice men of Israel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS77_32' data-id='PS77_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&#160;</span>In the midst of all this they sinned yet more, and believed not his miracles. </span>
<span class='v PS77_33' data-id='PS77_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&#160;</span>And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years with anxiety. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS77_34' data-id='PS77_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&#160;</span>When he slew them, they sought him: and they returned and called betimes upon God. </span>
<span class='v PS77_35' data-id='PS77_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&#160;</span>And they remembered that God was their helper, and the most high God was their redeemer. </span>
<span class='v PS77_36' data-id='PS77_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&#160;</span>Yet they loved him <span class='add'>only</span> with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue. </span>
<span class='v PS77_37' data-id='PS77_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&#160;</span>For their heart <span class='add'>was</span> not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS77_38' data-id='PS77_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&#160;</span>But he is compassionate, and will <span class='note' id='footnote-2152'><a href='#note-2152' class='key'>‡</a></span>forgive their sins, and will not destroy <span class='add'>them</span>: yea, he will frequently turn away his wrath, and will not kindle all his anger. </span>
<span class='v PS77_39' data-id='PS77_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&#160;</span>And he remembered that they are flesh; a wind that passes away, and returns not. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS77_40' data-id='PS77_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&#160;</span>How often did they provoke him in the wilderness, <span class='add'>and</span> anger him in a dry land! </span>
<span class='v PS77_41' data-id='PS77_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&#160;</span>Yea, they turned back, and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel. </span>
<span class='v PS77_42' data-id='PS77_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&#160;</span>They remembered not his hand, the day in which he delivered them from the hand of the oppressor. </span>
<span class='v PS77_43' data-id='PS77_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&#160;</span>How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanes: </span>
<span class='v PS77_44' data-id='PS77_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&#160;</span>and had changed their rivers into blood; and their <span class='note' id='footnote-2153'><a href='#note-2153' class='key'>§</a></span>streams, that they should not drink. </span>
<span class='v PS77_45' data-id='PS77_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&#160;</span>He sent against them the dog-fly, and it devoured them; and the frog, and it spoiled them. </span>
<span class='v PS77_46' data-id='PS77_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&#160;</span>And he gave their fruit to the canker worm, and their labours to the locust. </span>
<span class='v PS77_47' data-id='PS77_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&#160;</span>He killed their vines with hail, and their sycamores with frost. </span>
<span class='v PS77_48' data-id='PS77_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&#160;</span>And he gave up their cattle to hail, and their substance to the fire. </span>
<span class='v PS77_49' data-id='PS77_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&#160;</span>He sent out against them the fury of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and affliction, a message by evil angels. </span>
<span class='v PS77_50' data-id='PS77_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&#160;</span>He made a way for his wrath; he spared not their souls from death, but consigned their cattle to death; </span>
<span class='v PS77_51' data-id='PS77_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&#160;</span>and smote every first-born in the land of Egypt; the first-fruits of their labours in the tents of Cham. </span>
<span class='v PS77_52' data-id='PS77_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&#160;</span>And he removed his people like sheep; he led them as a flock in the wilderness. </span>
<span class='v PS77_53' data-id='PS77_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&#160;</span>And he guided them with hope, and they feared not: but the sea covered their enemies. </span>
<span class='v PS77_54' data-id='PS77_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&#160;</span>And he brought them in to the mountain of his sanctuary, this mountain which his right hand had purchased. </span>
<span class='v PS77_55' data-id='PS77_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&#160;</span>And he cast out the nations from before them, and made them to inherit by a line of inheritance, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS77_56' data-id='PS77_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&#160;</span>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies. </span>
<span class='v PS77_57' data-id='PS77_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&#160;</span>And they turned back, and broke covenant, even as also their fathers: they became like a crooked bow. </span>
<span class='v PS77_58' data-id='PS77_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&#160;</span>And they provoked him with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS77_59' data-id='PS77_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&#160;</span>God heard and <span class='note' id='footnote-2154'><a href='#note-2154' class='key'>**</a></span>lightly regarded <span class='add'>them</span>, and greatly despised Israel. </span>
<span class='v PS77_60' data-id='PS77_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&#160;</span>And he rejected the tabernacle of Selom, his tent where he dwelt among men. </span>
<span class='v PS77_61' data-id='PS77_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&#160;</span>And he gave their strength into captivity, and their beauty into the enemy's hand. </span>
<span class='v PS77_62' data-id='PS77_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&#160;</span>And he <span class='note' id='footnote-2155'><a href='#note-2155' class='key'>††</a></span>gave his people to the sword; and disdained his inheritance. </span>
<span class='v PS77_63' data-id='PS77_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&#160;</span>Fire devoured their young men; and their virgins mourned not. </span>
<span class='v PS77_64' data-id='PS77_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&#160;</span>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows shall not be wept for. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS77_65' data-id='PS77_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&#160;</span>So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, <span class='add'>and</span> as a mighty man who has been heated with wine. </span>
<span class='v PS77_66' data-id='PS77_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&#160;</span>And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he brought on them a perpetual reproach. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS77_67' data-id='PS77_67'><span class='v-num v-67'>67&#160;</span>And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim; </span>
<span class='v PS77_68' data-id='PS77_68'><span class='v-num v-68'>68&#160;</span>but chose the tribe of Juda, the mount Sion which he loved. </span>
<span class='v PS77_69' data-id='PS77_69'><span class='v-num v-69'>69&#160;</span>And he built his sanctuary as <span class='add'>the place</span> of unicorns; he founded it for ever on the earth. </span>
<span class='v PS77_70' data-id='PS77_70'><span class='v-num v-70'>70&#160;</span>He chose David also his servant, and took him up from the flocks of sheep. </span>
<span class='v PS77_71' data-id='PS77_71'><span class='v-num v-71'>71&#160;</span>He took him from following the ewes great with young, to be the shepherd of Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance. </span>
<span class='v PS77_72' data-id='PS77_72'><span class='v-num v-72'>72&#160;</span>So he tended them in the innocency of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands. </span></div></div>
