<span class='v PS30_2' data-id='PS30_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&#160;</span>O Lord, I have hoped in thee; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness and rescue me. </span>
<span class='v PS30_3' data-id='PS30_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&#160;</span>Incline thine ear to me; make haste to rescue me: be thou to me for a protecting God, and for a house of refuge to save me. </span>
<span class='v PS30_4' data-id='PS30_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&#160;</span>For thou art my strength and my refuge; and thou shalt guide me for thy name's sake, and maintain me. </span>
<span class='v PS30_5' data-id='PS30_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&#160;</span>Thou shalt bring me out of the snare which they have hidden for me; for thou, O Lord, art my defender. </span>
<span class='v PS30_6' data-id='PS30_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&#160;</span>Into thine hands I will commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth. </span>
<span class='v PS30_7' data-id='PS30_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&#160;</span>Thou hast hated them that idly persist in vanities: but I have hoped in the Lord. </span>
<span class='v PS30_8' data-id='PS30_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&#160;</span>I will exult and be glad in thy mercy: for thou hast looked upon mine affliction; thou hast saved my soul from distresses. </span>
<span class='v PS30_9' data-id='PS30_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&#160;</span>And thou hast not shut me up into the hands of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a wide place. </span></div>

<span class='v PS30_11' data-id='PS30_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&#160;</span>For my life is spent with grief, and my years with groanings: my strength has been weakened through poverty, and my bones are troubled. </span>
<span class='v PS30_12' data-id='PS30_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&#160;</span>I became a reproach among all mine enemies, but exceedingly so to my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that saw me without fled from me. </span>

<span class='v PS30_15' data-id='PS30_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&#160;</span>But I hoped in thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my God. </span>

<span class='v PS30_21' data-id='PS30_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&#160;</span>Thou wilt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the vexation of man: thou wilt screen them in a tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues. </span>
<span class='v PS30_22' data-id='PS30_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&#160;</span>Blessed be the Lord: for he has magnified his mercy in a fortified city. </span>
<span class='v PS30_23' data-id='PS30_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&#160;</span>But I said in my extreme fear, I am cast out from the sight of thine eyes: therefore thou didst hearken, O Lord, to the voice of my supplication when I cried to thee. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS30_24' data-id='PS30_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&#160;</span>Love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord seeks for truth, and renders <span class='add'>a reward</span> to them that deal very proudly. </span>
