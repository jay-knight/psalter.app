<span class='v PS37_1' data-id='PS37_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&#160;</span>A Psalm of David for remembrance concerning the Sabbath-day. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS37_2' data-id='PS37_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&#160;</span>O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath, neither chasten me in thine anger. </span>
<span class='v PS37_3' data-id='PS37_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&#160;</span>For thy weapons are fixed in me, and thou hast pressed thy hand heavily upon me. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS37_4' data-id='PS37_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&#160;</span>For there is no health in my flesh because of thine anger; there is no peace to my bones because of my sins. </span>
<span class='v PS37_5' data-id='PS37_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&#160;</span>For my transgressions have gone over mine head: they have pressed heavily upon me like a weighty burden. </span>
<span class='v PS37_6' data-id='PS37_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&#160;</span>My bruises have become noisome and corrupt, because of my foolishness. </span>
<span class='v PS37_7' data-id='PS37_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&#160;</span>I have been wretched and bowed down continually: I went with a mourning countenance all the day. </span>
<span class='v PS37_8' data-id='PS37_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&#160;</span>For my soul is filled with mockings; and there is no health in my flesh. </span>
<span class='v PS37_9' data-id='PS37_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&#160;</span>I have been afflicted and brought down exceedingly: I have roared for the groaning of my heart. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS37_10' data-id='PS37_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&#160;</span>But all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hidden from thee. </span>
<span class='v PS37_11' data-id='PS37_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&#160;</span>My heart is troubled, my strength has failed me; and the light of mine eyes is not with me. </span>
<span class='v PS37_12' data-id='PS37_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&#160;</span>My friends and my neighbours drew near before me, and stood still; and my nearest of kin stood afar off. </span>
<span class='v PS37_13' data-id='PS37_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&#160;</span>While they pressed hard upon me that sought my soul: and they that sought my hurt spoke vanities, and devised deceits all the day. </span>
<span class='v PS37_14' data-id='PS37_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&#160;</span>But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and was as a dumb man not opening his mouth. </span>
<span class='v PS37_15' data-id='PS37_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&#160;</span>And I was as a man that hears not, and who has no reproofs in his mouth. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS37_16' data-id='PS37_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&#160;</span>For I hoped in thee, O Lord: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. </span>
<span class='v PS37_17' data-id='PS37_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&#160;</span>For I said, Lest mine enemies rejoice against me: for when my feet were moved, they spoke boastingly against me. </span>
<span class='v PS37_18' data-id='PS37_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&#160;</span>For I am ready for <span class='note' id='footnote-2071'><a href='#note-2071' class='key'>*</a></span>plagues, and my grief is continually before me. </span>
<span class='v PS37_19' data-id='PS37_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&#160;</span>For I will declare mine iniquity, and be distressed for my sin. </span>
<span class='v PS37_20' data-id='PS37_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&#160;</span>But mine enemies live, and are mightier than I: and they that hate me unjustly are multiplied. </span>
<span class='v PS37_21' data-id='PS37_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&#160;</span>They that reward evil for good slandered me; because I followed righteousness. </span>
<span class='v PS37_22' data-id='PS37_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&#160;</span>Forsake me not, O Lord my God: depart not from me. </span>
<span class='v PS37_23' data-id='PS37_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&#160;</span>Draw nigh to my help, O Lord of my salvation. </span></div></div>
