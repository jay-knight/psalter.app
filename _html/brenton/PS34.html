<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS34_1' data-id='PS34_1'>Judge thou, O Lord, them that injure me, fight against them that fight against me. </span>
<span class='v PS34_2' data-id='PS34_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&#160;</span>Take hold of shield and buckler, and arise for my help. </span>
<span class='v PS34_3' data-id='PS34_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&#160;</span>Bring forth a sword, and stop <span class='add'>the way</span> against them that persecute me: say to my soul, I am thy salvation. </span>
<span class='v PS34_4' data-id='PS34_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&#160;</span>Let them that seek my soul be ashamed and confounded: let them that devise evils against me be turned back and put to shame. </span>
<span class='v PS34_5' data-id='PS34_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&#160;</span>Let them be as dust before the wind, and an angel of the Lord afflicting them. </span>
<span class='v PS34_6' data-id='PS34_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&#160;</span>Let their way be dark and slippery, and an angel of the Lord persecuting them. </span>
<span class='v PS34_7' data-id='PS34_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&#160;</span>For without cause they have hid for me their destructive snare: without a cause they have reproached my soul. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS34_8' data-id='PS34_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&#160;</span>Let a snare which they know not come upon them: and the gin which they hid take them; and let them fall into the very same snare. </span>
<span class='v PS34_9' data-id='PS34_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&#160;</span>But my soul shall exult in the Lord: it shall delight in his salvation. </span>
<span class='v PS34_10' data-id='PS34_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&#160;</span>All my bones shall say, O Lord, who is like to thee? delivering the poor out of the hand of them that are stronger than he, yea, the poor and needy one from them that spoil him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS34_11' data-id='PS34_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&#160;</span>Unjust witnesses arose, and asked me of things I knew not. </span>
<span class='v PS34_12' data-id='PS34_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&#160;</span>They rewarded me evil for good, and bereavement to my soul. </span>
<span class='v PS34_13' data-id='PS34_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&#160;</span>But I, when they troubled me, put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul with fasting: and my prayer shall return to my <span class='add'>own</span> bosom. </span>
<span class='v PS34_14' data-id='PS34_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&#160;</span>I behaved agreeably towards them as <span class='add'>if it had been</span> our neighbour <span class='add'>or</span> brother: I humbled myself as one mourning and sad of countenance. </span>
<span class='v PS34_15' data-id='PS34_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&#160;</span>Yet they rejoiced against me, and plagues were <span class='note' id='footnote-2062'><a href='#note-2062' class='key'>*</a></span>plentifully brought against me, and I knew <span class='add'>it</span> not: they were scattered, but <span class='note' id='footnote-2063'><a href='#note-2063' class='key'>†</a></span>repented not. </span>
<span class='v PS34_16' data-id='PS34_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&#160;</span>They tempted me, they sneered at me most contemptuously, they gnashed their teeth upon me. </span></div>

<span class='v PS34_19' data-id='PS34_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&#160;</span>Let not them that are mine enemies without a cause rejoice against me; who hate me for nothing, and wink with their eyes. </span>
<span class='v PS34_20' data-id='PS34_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&#160;</span>For to me they spoke peaceably, but imagined deceits in <span class='add'>their</span> anger. </span>
<span class='v PS34_21' data-id='PS34_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&#160;</span>And they opened wide their mouth upon me; they said, Aha, aha, our eyes have seen <span class='add'>it</span>. </span></div>

<span class='v PS34_22' data-id='PS34_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&#160;</span>Thou hast seen <span class='add'>it</span>, O Lord: keep not silence: O Lord, withdraw not <span class='add'>thyself</span> from me. </span>
<span class='v PS34_23' data-id='PS34_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&#160;</span>Awake, O Lord, and attend to my judgment, <span class='add'>even</span> to my cause, my God and my Lord. </span>
<span class='v PS34_24' data-id='PS34_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&#160;</span>Judge me, O Lord, according to thy righteousness, O Lord my God; and let them not rejoice against me. </span>
<span class='v PS34_25' data-id='PS34_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&#160;</span>Let them not say in their hearts, Aha, aha, <span class='add'>it is pleasing</span> to our soul: neither let them say, We have devoured him. </span>
<span class='v PS34_26' data-id='PS34_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&#160;</span>Let them be confounded and ashamed together that rejoice at my afflictions: let them be clothed with shame and confusion that speak great swelling words against me. </span>
<span class='v PS34_27' data-id='PS34_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&#160;</span>Let them that rejoice in my righteousness exult and be glad: and let them say continually, The Lord be magnified, who desire the peace of his servant. </span>
<span class='v PS34_28' data-id='PS34_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&#160;</span>And my tongue shall meditate on thy righteousness, <span class='add'>and</span> on thy praise all the day. </span></div></div>
