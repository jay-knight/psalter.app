<span class='v PS72_1' data-id='PS72_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&#160;</span>A Psalm for Asaph. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS72_1' data-id='PS72_1'>How good is God to Israel, to the upright in heart! </span>
<span class='v PS72_2' data-id='PS72_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&#160;</span>But my feet were almost overthrown; my goings very nearly slipped. </span>
<span class='v PS72_3' data-id='PS72_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&#160;</span>For I was jealous of the transgressors, beholding the tranquillity of sinners. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS72_4' data-id='PS72_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&#160;</span>For there is no sign of reluctance in their death: and <span class='add'>they have</span> firmness under their affliction. </span>
<span class='v PS72_5' data-id='PS72_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&#160;</span>They are not in the troubles of <span class='add'>other</span> men; and they shall not be scourged with <span class='add'>other</span> men. </span>
<span class='v PS72_6' data-id='PS72_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&#160;</span>Therefore pride has possessed them; they have clothed themselves with their injustice and ungodliness. </span>
<span class='v PS72_7' data-id='PS72_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&#160;</span>Their injustice shall go forth as out of fatness: they have fulfilled their intention. </span>
<span class='v PS72_8' data-id='PS72_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&#160;</span>They have taken counsel and spoken in wickedness: they have uttered unrighteousness loftily. </span>
<span class='v PS72_9' data-id='PS72_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&#160;</span>They have set their mouth against heaven, and their tongue has gone through upon the earth. </span>
<span class='v PS72_10' data-id='PS72_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&#160;</span>Therefore shall my people return hither: and full days shall be found <span class='note' id='footnote-2138'><a href='#note-2138' class='key'>*</a></span>with them. </span>
<span class='v PS72_11' data-id='PS72_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&#160;</span>And they said, How does God know? and <span class='note' id='footnote-2139'><a href='#note-2139' class='key'>†</a></span>is there knowledge in the Most High? </span>
<span class='v PS72_12' data-id='PS72_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&#160;</span>Behold, these <span class='add'>are</span> the sinners, and they that prosper always: they have possessed wealth. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS72_13' data-id='PS72_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&#160;</span>And I said, Verily in vain have I justified my heart, and washed my hands in innocency. </span>
<span class='v PS72_14' data-id='PS72_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&#160;</span>For I was plagued all the day, and my reproof <span class='add'>was</span> every morning. </span>
<span class='v PS72_15' data-id='PS72_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&#160;</span>If I said, I will speak thus; behold, I <span class='add'>should</span> have broken covenant with the generation of thy children. </span>
<span class='v PS72_16' data-id='PS72_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&#160;</span>And I undertook to understand this, <span class='add'>but</span> it is too hard for me, </span>
<span class='v PS72_17' data-id='PS72_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&#160;</span>until I go into the sanctuary of God; <span class='add'>and so</span> understand the latter end. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS72_18' data-id='PS72_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&#160;</span>Surely thou hast appointed <span class='add'>judgments</span> to them because of their crafty dealings: thou hast cast them down when they were lifted up. </span>
<span class='v PS72_19' data-id='PS72_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&#160;</span>How have they become desolate! suddenly they have failed: they have perished because of their iniquity. </span>
<span class='v PS72_20' data-id='PS72_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&#160;</span>As the dream of one awakening, O Lord, in thy city thou wilt despise their image. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS72_21' data-id='PS72_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&#160;</span>For my heart has rejoiced, and my reins have been <span class='note' id='footnote-2140'><a href='#note-2140' class='key'>‡</a></span>gladdened. </span>
<span class='v PS72_22' data-id='PS72_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&#160;</span>But I <span class='add'>was</span> vile and knew not: I became brutish before thee. </span>
<span class='v PS72_23' data-id='PS72_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&#160;</span>Yet I am continually with thee: thou hast holden my right hand. </span>
<span class='v PS72_24' data-id='PS72_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&#160;</span>Thou hast guided me by thy counsel, and thou hast taken me to thyself with glory. </span>
<span class='v PS72_25' data-id='PS72_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&#160;</span>For what have I in heaven <span class='add'>but thee</span>? and what have I desired upon the earth beside thee? </span>
<span class='v PS72_26' data-id='PS72_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&#160;</span>My heart and my flesh have failed: <span class='add'>but</span> God <span class='add'>is the strength</span> of my heart, and God is my portion for ever. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS72_27' data-id='PS72_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&#160;</span>For, behold, they that remove themselves far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed every one that goes a whoring from thee. </span>
<span class='v PS72_28' data-id='PS72_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&#160;</span>But it is good for me to cleave close to God, to put my trust in the Lord; that I may proclaim all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion. </span></div></div>
