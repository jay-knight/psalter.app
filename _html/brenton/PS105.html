<span class='v PS105_6' data-id='PS105_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&#160;</span>We have sinned with our fathers, we have transgressed, we have done unrighteously. </span>
<span class='v PS105_7' data-id='PS105_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&#160;</span>Our fathers in Egypt understood not thy wonders, and remembered not the multitude of thy mercy; but provoked <span class='add'>him</span> as they went up by the Red Sea. </span>
<span class='v PS105_8' data-id='PS105_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&#160;</span>Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might cause his mighty power to be known. </span>
<span class='v PS105_9' data-id='PS105_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&#160;</span>And he rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up: so he led them through the deep as through the wilderness. </span>
<span class='v PS105_10' data-id='PS105_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&#160;</span>And he saved them out of the hand of them that hated <span class='add'>them</span>, and redeemed them out of the hand of the enemy. </span>
<span class='v PS105_11' data-id='PS105_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&#160;</span>The water covered those that oppressed them: there was not one of them left. </span>
<span class='v PS105_12' data-id='PS105_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&#160;</span>Then they believed his words, and celebrated his praise. </span>
<span class='v PS105_13' data-id='PS105_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&#160;</span>They made haste, they forgot his works; they waited not for his counsel. </span>
<span class='v PS105_14' data-id='PS105_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&#160;</span>And they lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the dry <span class='add'>land</span>. </span>
<span class='v PS105_15' data-id='PS105_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&#160;</span>And he gave them their request, and sent fulness into their souls. </span></div>

<span class='v PS105_16' data-id='PS105_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&#160;</span>They provoked Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the holy one of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v PS105_17' data-id='PS105_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&#160;</span>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and closed upon the congregation of Abiron. </span>
<span class='v PS105_18' data-id='PS105_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&#160;</span>And a fire was kindled in their congregation, and a flame burnt up the sinners. </span></div>

<span class='v PS105_19' data-id='PS105_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&#160;</span>And they made a calf in Choreb, and worshipped the graven image, </span>
<span class='v PS105_20' data-id='PS105_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&#160;</span>and they changed their glory into the similitude of a calf that feeds on grass. </span>
<span class='v PS105_21' data-id='PS105_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&#160;</span>They forgot God that saved them, who had wrought great deeds in Egypt; </span>
<span class='v PS105_22' data-id='PS105_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&#160;</span>wondrous <span class='add'>works</span> in the land of Cham, and terrible things at the Red Sea. </span>
<span class='v PS105_23' data-id='PS105_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&#160;</span>So he said that he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn <span class='add'>him</span> away from the fierceness of his anger, so that he should not destroy them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS105_24' data-id='PS105_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&#160;</span>Moreover they set at nought the desirable land, and believed not his word. </span>
<span class='v PS105_25' data-id='PS105_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&#160;</span>And they murmured in their tents: they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v PS105_26' data-id='PS105_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&#160;</span>So he lifted up his hand against them, to cast them down in the wilderness; </span>
<span class='v PS105_27' data-id='PS105_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&#160;</span>and to cast down their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the countries. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS105_28' data-id='PS105_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&#160;</span>They were joined also to Beelphegor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. And they provoked him with their devices; </span>
<span class='v PS105_29' data-id='PS105_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&#160;</span>and destruction was multiplied among them. </span>
<span class='v PS105_30' data-id='PS105_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&#160;</span>Then Phinees stood up, and made atonement: and the plague ceased. </span>
<span class='v PS105_31' data-id='PS105_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&#160;</span>And it was counted to him for righteousness, to all generations for ever. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS105_32' data-id='PS105_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&#160;</span>They provoked him also at the water of Strife, and Moses was hurt for their sakes; </span>
<span class='v PS105_33' data-id='PS105_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&#160;</span>for they provoked his spirit, and he <span class='note' id='footnote-2215'><a href='#note-2215' class='key'>*</a></span>spoke <span class='add'>unadvisedly</span> with his lips. </span></div>

<span class='v PS105_34' data-id='PS105_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&#160;</span>They destroyed not the nations which the Lord told them <span class='add'>to destroy</span>; </span>
<span class='v PS105_35' data-id='PS105_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&#160;</span>but were mingled with the heathen, and learned their works. </span>
<span class='v PS105_36' data-id='PS105_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&#160;</span>And they served their graven images; and it became an offence to them. </span>
<span class='v PS105_37' data-id='PS105_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&#160;</span>And they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils, </span>
<span class='v PS105_38' data-id='PS105_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&#160;</span>and shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan; and the land was <span class='note' id='footnote-2216'><a href='#note-2216' class='key'>†</a></span>defiled with blood, </span>
<span class='v PS105_39' data-id='PS105_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&#160;</span>and was polluted with their works; and they went a whoring with their own devices. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS105_40' data-id='PS105_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&#160;</span>So the Lord was very angry with his people, and he abhorred his inheritance. </span>
<span class='v PS105_41' data-id='PS105_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&#160;</span>And he delivered them into the hands of <span class='add'>their</span> enemies; and they that hated them ruled over them. </span>
<span class='v PS105_42' data-id='PS105_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&#160;</span>And their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought down under their hands. </span>
<span class='v PS105_43' data-id='PS105_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&#160;</span>Many a time he delivered them; but they provoked him by their counsel, and they were brought low by their iniquities. </span>
<span class='v PS105_44' data-id='PS105_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&#160;</span>Yet the Lord looked upon their affliction, when he heard their petition. </span>
<span class='v PS105_45' data-id='PS105_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&#160;</span>And he remembered his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercy. </span>
<span class='v PS105_46' data-id='PS105_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&#160;</span>And he caused them to be pitied in the sight of all who carried them captive. </span></div>
