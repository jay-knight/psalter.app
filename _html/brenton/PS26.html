<span class='v PS26_1' data-id='PS26_1'>The Lord is my light and my Saviour; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the defender of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? </span>
<span class='v PS26_2' data-id='PS26_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&#160;</span>When evil-doers drew nigh against me to eat up my flesh, my persecutors and mine enemies, they fainted and fell. </span>
<span class='v PS26_3' data-id='PS26_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&#160;</span>Though an army should set itself in array against me, my heart shall not be afraid: though war should rise up against me, in this am I confident. </span>
<span class='v PS26_4' data-id='PS26_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&#160;</span>One thing have I asked of the Lord, this will I earnestly seek: that I should dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, that I should behold the fair beauty of the Lord, and survey his temple. </span>
<span class='v PS26_5' data-id='PS26_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&#160;</span>For in the day of mine afflictions he hid me in his tabernacle: he sheltered me in the secret of his tabernacle; he set me up on a rock. </span>
<span class='v PS26_6' data-id='PS26_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&#160;</span>And now, behold, he has lifted up mine head over mine enemies: I went round and offered in his tabernacle the sacrifice of <span class='note' id='footnote-2043'><a href='#note-2043' class='key'>*</a></span>joy; I will sing, <span class='note' id='footnote-2044'><a href='#note-2044' class='key'>†</a></span>even sing psalms to the Lord. </span></div>

<span class='v PS26_7' data-id='PS26_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&#160;</span>Hear, O Lord, my voice which I have uttered aloud: pity me, and hearken to me. </span>
<span class='v PS26_8' data-id='PS26_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&#160;</span>My heart said to thee, I have diligently sought thy face: thy face, O Lord, I will seek. </span>
<span class='v PS26_9' data-id='PS26_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&#160;</span>Turn not thy face away from me, turn not thou away from thy servant in anger: be thou my helper, forsake me not; and, O God my Saviour, overlook me not. </span>
<span class='v PS26_10' data-id='PS26_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&#160;</span>For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but the Lord has taken me to himself. </span>
<span class='v PS26_11' data-id='PS26_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&#160;</span>Teach me, O Lord, in thy way, and guide me in a right path, because of mine enemies. </span>
<span class='v PS26_12' data-id='PS26_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&#160;</span>Deliver me not over to the desire of them that afflict me; for unjust witnesses have risen up against me, and injustice has lied within herself. </span></div>
