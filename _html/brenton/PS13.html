<span class='v PS13_1' data-id='PS13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&#160;</span>For the end, a Psalm of David. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS13_1' data-id='PS13_1'>The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They have corrupted <span class='add'>themselves</span>, and become abominable in their devices; there is none that does goodness, there is not even so much as one. </span>
<span class='v PS13_2' data-id='PS13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&#160;</span>The Lord looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any that understood, or sought after God. </span>
<span class='v PS13_3' data-id='PS13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&#160;</span>They are all gone out of the way, they are together become good for nothing, there is none that does good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood: destruction and misery are in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS13_4' data-id='PS13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&#160;</span>Will not all the workers of iniquity know, who eat up my people as they would eat bread? they have not called upon the Lord. </span>
<span class='v PS13_5' data-id='PS13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&#160;</span>There were they alarmed with fear, where there was no fear; for God is in the righteous generation. </span>
<span class='v PS13_6' data-id='PS13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&#160;</span>Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his hope. </span>
<span class='v PS13_7' data-id='PS13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&#160;</span>Who will bring the salvation of Israel out of Sion? when the Lord brings back the captivity of his people, let Jacob exult, and Israel be glad. </span></div></div>
