<div class='p'>
<span class='v PS43_2' data-id='PS43_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&#160;</span>O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us, the work which thou wroughtest in their days, in the days of old. </span>
<span class='v PS43_3' data-id='PS43_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&#160;</span>Thine hand utterly destroyed the heathen, and thou didst plant them: thou didst afflict the nations, and cast them out. </span>
<span class='v PS43_4' data-id='PS43_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&#160;</span>For they inherited not the land by their <span class='add'>own</span> sword, and their <span class='add'>own</span> arm did not deliver them; but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou wert well pleased in them. </span></div>

<span class='v PS43_5' data-id='PS43_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&#160;</span>Thou art indeed my King and my God, who commandest deliverances for Jacob. </span>
<span class='v PS43_6' data-id='PS43_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&#160;</span>In thee will we push down our enemies, and in thy name will we bring to nought them that rise up against us. </span>
<span class='v PS43_7' data-id='PS43_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&#160;</span>For I will not trust in my bow, and my sword shall not save me. </span>
<span class='v PS43_8' data-id='PS43_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&#160;</span>For thou hast saved us from them that afflicted us, and hast put to shame them that hated us. </span>

<span class='v PS43_10' data-id='PS43_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&#160;</span>But now thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and thou wilt not go forth with our hosts. </span>
<span class='v PS43_11' data-id='PS43_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&#160;</span>Thou hast turned us back before our enemies; and they that hated us spoiled for themselves. </span>

<span class='v PS43_13' data-id='PS43_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&#160;</span>Thou hast sold thy people without price, and there was no profit by their exchange. </span>
<span class='v PS43_14' data-id='PS43_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&#160;</span>Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. </span>
<span class='v PS43_15' data-id='PS43_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&#160;</span>Thou hast made us a proverb among the Gentiles, a shaking of the head among the nations. </span>
<span class='v PS43_16' data-id='PS43_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&#160;</span>All the day my shame is before me, and the confusion of my face has covered me, </span>
<span class='v PS43_17' data-id='PS43_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&#160;</span>because of the voice of the slanderer and reviler; because of the enemy and avenger. </span></div>

<span class='v PS43_18' data-id='PS43_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&#160;</span>All these things are come upon us: but we have not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt unrighteously in thy covenant. </span>
<span class='v PS43_19' data-id='PS43_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&#160;</span>And our heart has not gone back; but thou hast turned aside our paths from thy way. </span>
<span class='v PS43_20' data-id='PS43_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&#160;</span>For thou hast laid us low in a place of affliction, and the shadow of death has covered us. </span>
<span class='v PS43_21' data-id='PS43_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&#160;</span>If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have spread out our hands to a strange god; shall not God search these things out? </span>
<span class='v PS43_22' data-id='PS43_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&#160;</span>for he knows the secrets of the heart. </span>
