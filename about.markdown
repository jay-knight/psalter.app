>Let each one who recites the Psalms have a sure hope that through them God will speedily give ear to those who are in need.

*\- St. Athanasius the Great*

-----

The Psalms are the primary prayers of the Church. This Psalter uses the Kathisma groupings used in the Orthodox Church.

The text of this psalter is from the [Brenton](/) translation of the Septuagint, [LXX2012](/lxx2012) (and update to Brenton's with modern American English) and the [KJV](/kjv). All three are in the public domain.

This site/app provides only the text of the Psalms without any other features that can cause distraction or slowness. The static site is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the site source is available under the MIT License at [GitHub](https://github.com/jay-knight/psalter.app/).
