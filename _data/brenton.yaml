      things under his feet:
    '7': 'sheep and all oxen, yea, and the cattle of the field;'

      all thy wonderful works.
    '2': >-
      I will be glad and exult in thee: I will sing to thy name, O thou Most

      Sing praises to the Lord, who dwells in Sion: declare his dealings among
      the nations.
    '12': >-
      For he remembered them, in making inquisition for blood: he has not
      forgotten the supplication of the poor.
    '13': >-
      Have mercy upon me, O Lord; look upon my affliction which I suffer of mine
      enemies, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:

      The Lord is known as executing judgments: the sinner is taken in the works
      of his hands. A song of Pause.
    '17': >-
      Let sinners be driven away into Hades, even all the nations that forget
      God.
    '18': >-
      For the poor shall not be forgotten for ever: the patience of the needy
      ones shall not perish for ever.
    '19': 'Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged before thee.'
    '20': >-
      Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them: let the heathen know that they are

    '21': >-
      Why standest thou afar off, O Lord? why dost thou overlook us in times of
      need, in affliction?
    '22': >-
      While the ungodly one acts proudly, the poor is hotly pursued: the wicked
      are taken in the crafty counsels which they imagine.

      Because the sinner praises himself for the desires of his heart; and the
      unjust one blesses himself.
    '24': >-
      The sinner has provoked the Lord: according to the abundance of his pride
      he will not seek after him: God is not before him.
    '25': >-
      His ways are profane at all times; thy judgments are removed from before
      him: he will gain the mastery over all his enemies.
    '26': >-
      For he has said in his heart, I shall not be moved, continuing without
      evil from generation to generation.
    '27': >-
      Whose mouth is full of cursing, and bitterness, and fraud: under his
      tongue are trouble and pain.

      innocent: his eyes are set against the poor.
    '29': >-
      He lies in wait in secret as a lion in his den: he lies in wait to ravish
      the poor, to ravish the poor when he draws him after him: he will bring
      him down in his snare.
    '30': He will bow down and fall when he has mastered the poor.
    '31': >-
      For he has said in his heart, God has forgotten: he has turned away his
      face so as never to look.
    '32': 'Arise, O Lord God; let thy hand be lifted up: forget not the poor.'
    '33': >-
      Wherefore has the wicked provoked God? for he has said in his heart, He
      will not require it.
    '34': >-
      Thou seest it; for thou dost observe trouble and wrath, to deliver them
      into thy hands: the poor has been left to thee; thou wast a helper to the
      orphan.
    '35': >-
      Break thou the arm of the sinner and wicked man: his sin shall be sought
      for, and shall not be found.
    '36': >-
      The Lord shall reign for ever, even for ever and ever: ye Gentiles shall
      perish out of his land.
    '37': >-
      The Lord has heard the desire of the poor: thine ear has inclined to the
      preparation of their heart;
    '38': >-

      earth.

    '1': >-
      For behold the sinners have bent their bow, they have prepared their
      arrows for the quiver, to shoot privily at the upright in heart.
    '2': >-
      For they have pulled down what thou didst frame, but what has the
      righteous done?
    '3': >-
      The Lord is in his holy temple, as for the Lord, his throne is in heaven:
      his eyes look upon the poor, his eyelids try the sons of men.
    '4': >-
      The Lord tries the righteous and the ungodly: and he that loves
      unrighteousness hates his own soul.
    '5': >-
      He shall rain upon sinners snares, fire, and brimstone, and a stormy blast
      shall be the portion of their cup.

      they have spoken with a double heart.
    '3': >-
      Let the Lord destroy all the deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaks
      great words:
    '4': >-
      who have said, We will magnify our tongue; our lips are our own: who is
      Lord of us?
    '5': >-
      Because of the misery of the poor, and because of the sighing of the
      needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord, I will set them in safety; I will
      speak to them thereof openly.
    '6': >-
      The oracles of the Lord are pure oracles; as silver tried in the fire,
      proved in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.

      Thou, O Lord, shalt keep us, and shalt preserve us, from this generation,
      and for ever.

      daily? how long shall my enemy be exalted over me?

      Look on me, hearken to me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep

    '1': >-
      The Lord looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there
      were any that understood, or sought after God.
    '2': >-
      They are all gone out of the way, they are together become good for
      nothing, there is none that does good, no not one. Their throat is an open
      sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is
      under their lips: whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their
      feet are swift to shed blood: destruction and misery are in their ways;
      and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before

      They have enclosed themselves with their own fat: their mouth has spoken
      pride.

      when thy glory appears.

      For the end, a Psalm of David the servant of the Lord; the words which he
      spoke to the Lord, even the words of this Song, in the day in which the
      Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand
      of Saul: and he said:
  verses:

    '2': >-
      The Lord is my firm support, and my refuge, and my deliverer; my God is my

      salvation, and my helper.
    '3': >-
      I will call upon the Lord with praises, and I shall be saved from mine

      presence: coals were kindled at it.

      feet.
    '10': 'And he mounted on cherubs and flew: he flew on the wings of winds.'

      exposed, at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blasting of the breath of thy
      wrath.
    '16': >-
      He sent from on high and took me, he drew me to himself out of many
      waters.

      He will deliver me from my mighty enemies, and from them that hate me; for
      they are stronger than I.

      me.

      iniquity.

      For thou wilt save the lowly people, and wilt humble the eyes of the
      proud.

      I will dash them to pieces and they shall not be able to stand: they shall
      fall under my feet.

      For thou hast girded me with strength for war: thou hast beaten down under
      me all that rose up against me.
    '40': >-
      And thou hast made mine enemies turn their backs before me; and thou hast
      destroyed them that hated me.

      dust before the wind.

      Deliver me from the gainsayings of the people: thou shalt make me head of

      their being honoured and exalted have utterly vanished like smoke.

      compassion, and gives.

      shall be utterly destroyed.

      pleasure in his way.

      ungodly shall be utterly destroyed.
    '28': 'But the righteous shall inherit the earth, and dwell upon it for ever.'
    '29': >-

      Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the
      land: when the wicked are destroyed, thou shalt see it.
    '34': >-
      I saw the ungodly very highly exalting himself, and lifting himself up
      like the cedars of Libanus.

      not found.

      Maintain innocence, and behold uprightness: for there is a remnant to the
      peaceable man.

      Let my mouth be filled with praise, that I may hymn thy glory, and thy

      Cast me not off at the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength
      fails.

      soul have taken counsel together,

      to deliver him.

    '13': 'But I will hope continually, and will praise thee more and more.'
    '14': >-
      My mouth shall declare thy righteousness openly, and thy salvation all the

      shall have declared thine arm to all the generation that is to come:
    '18': >-
      even thy power and thy righteousness, O God, up to the highest heavens,
      even the mighty works which thou hast done: O God, who is like to thee?
    '19': >-
      What afflictions many and sore hast thou shewed me! yet thou didst turn
      and quicken me, and broughtest me again from the depths of the earth.

      Thou didst multiply thy righteousness, and didst turn and comfort me, and
      broughtest me again out of the depths of the earth.

      I will also therefore give thanks to thee, O God, because of thy truth, on
      an instrument of psalmody: I will sing psalms to thee on the harp, O Holy
      One of Israel.
    '22': >-
      My lips shall rejoice when I sing to thee; and my soul, which thou hast
      redeemed.

      Let his name be blessed for ever: his name shall endure longer than the
      sun: and all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed in him: all nations
      shall call him blessed.
