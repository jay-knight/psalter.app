# Psalm 27

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. To thee, O Lord, have I cried; my God, be not silent toward me: lest thou be silent toward me, and so I should be likened to them that go down to the pit. <sup>2</sup> Hearken to the voice of my supplication, when I pray to thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy temple. <sup>3</sup> Draw not away my soul with sinners, and destroy me not with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace with their neighbours, but evils are in their hearts. <sup>4</sup> Give them according to their works, and according to the wickedness of their devices: give them according to the works of their hands; render their recompence unto them. <sup>5</sup> Because they have not attended to the works of the Lord, even to the works of his hands, thou shalt pull them down, and shalt not build them up. <sup>6</sup> Blessed be the Lord, for he has hearkened to the voice of my petition. <sup>7</sup> The Lord is my helper and my defender; my heart has hoped in him, and I am helped: my flesh has revived, and willingly will I give praise to him. <sup>8</sup> The Lord is the strength of his people, and the saving defender of his anointed. <sup>9</sup> Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: and take care of them, and lift them up for ever.
