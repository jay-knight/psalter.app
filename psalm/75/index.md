<div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">1</sup> For the end, among the Hymns, a Psalm for Asaph; a Song for the Assyrian. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">2</sup> God is known in Judea; his name is great in Israel. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">3</sup> And his place has been in peace, and his dwelling-place in Sion. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">4</sup> There he broke the power of the bows, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Pause. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">5</sup> Thou dost wonderfully shine forth from the everlasting mountains. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">6</sup> All the simple ones in heart were troubled; all the men of wealth have slept their sleep, and have found nothing in their hands. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">7</sup> At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, the riders on horses slumbered. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">8</sup> Thou art terrible; and who shall withstand thee, because of thine anger? </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">9</sup> Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still, </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">10</sup> when God arose to judgment, to save all the meek in heart. Pause. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">11</sup> For the inward thought of man shall give thanks to thee: and the memorial of his inward thought shall keep a feast to thee. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">12</sup> Vow, and pay your vows to the Lord our God; all that are round about him shall bring gifts, even to him that is terrible, </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">13</sup> and that takes away the spirits of princes; to him that is terrible among the kings of the earth. </div>
