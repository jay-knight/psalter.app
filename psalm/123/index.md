# Psalm 123

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Degrees. If it had not been that the Lord was among us, let Israel now say; <sup>2</sup> if it had not been that the Lord was among us, when men rose up against us; <sup>3</sup> verily they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us: <sup>4</sup> verily the water would have drowned us, our soul would have gone under the torrent. <sup>5</sup> Yea, our soul would have gone under the overwhelming water. <sup>6</sup> Blessed be the Lord, who has not given us for a prey to their teeth. <sup>7</sup> Our soul has been delivered as a sparrow from the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are delivered. <sup>8</sup> Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
