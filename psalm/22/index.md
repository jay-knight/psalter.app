# Psalm 22

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. The Lord tends me as a shepherd, and I shall want nothing. <sup>2</sup> In a place of green grass, there he has made me dwell: he has nourished me by the water of rest. <sup>3</sup> He has restored my soul: he has guided me into the paths of righteousness, for his name's sake. <sup>4</sup> Yea, even if I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will not be afraid of evils: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff, these have comforted me. <sup>5</sup> Thou hast prepared a table before me in presence of them that afflict me: thou hast thoroughly anointed my head with oil; and thy cup cheers me like the best wine. <sup>6</sup> Thy mercy also shall follow me all the days of my life: and my dwelling shall be in the house of the Lord for a very long time.
