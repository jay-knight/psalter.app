# Psalm 95

<sup>1</sup> When the house was built after the Captivity, a Song by David. Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth. <sup>2</sup> Sing to the Lord, bless his name: proclaim his salvation from day to day. <sup>3</sup> Publish his glory among the Gentiles, his wonderful works among all people. <sup>4</sup> For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: he is terrible above all gods. <sup>5</sup> For all the gods of the heathen are devils: but the Lord made the heavens. <sup>6</sup> Thanksgiving and beauty are before him: holiness and majesty are in his sanctuary. <sup>7</sup> Bring to the Lord, ye families of the Gentiles, bring to the Lord glory and honour. <sup>8</sup> Bring to the Lord the glory becoming his name: take offerings, and go into his courts. <sup>9</sup> Worship the Lord in his holy court: let all the earth tremble before him. <sup>10</sup> Say among the heathen, The Lord reigns: for he has established the world so that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people in righteousness. <sup>11</sup> Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth exult; let the sea be moved, and the fulness of it. <sup>12</sup> The plains shall rejoice, and all things in them: then shall all the trees of the wood exult before the presence of the Lord: <sup>13</sup> for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth; he shall judge the world in righteousness, and the people with his truth.
