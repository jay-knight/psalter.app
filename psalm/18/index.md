# Psalm 18

<sup>1</sup> For the end, a Psalm of David. <sup>2</sup> The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament proclaims the work of his hands. <sup>3</sup> Day to day utters speech, and night to night proclaims knowledge. <sup>4</sup> There are no speeches or words, in which their voices are not heard. <sup>5</sup> Their voice is gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world. <sup>6</sup> In the sun he has set his tabernacle; and he comes forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber: he will exult as a giant to run his course. <sup>7</sup> His going forth is from the extremity of heaven, and his circuit to the other end of heaven: and no one shall be hidden from his heat. <sup>8</sup> The law of the Lord is perfect, converting souls: the testimony of the Lord is faithful, instructing babes. <sup>9</sup> The ordinances of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is bright, enlightening the eyes. <sup>10</sup> The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring for ever and ever: the judgments of the Lord are true, and justified altogether. <sup>11</sup> To be desired more than gold, and much precious stone: sweeter also than honey and the honey-comb. <sup>12</sup> For thy servant keeps to them: in the keeping of them there is great reward. <sup>13</sup> Who will understand his transgressions? purge thou me from my secret sins. <sup>14</sup> And spare thy servant the attack of strangers: if they do not gain the dominion over me, then shall I be blameless, and I shall be clear from great sin. <sup>15</sup> So shall the sayings of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be pleasing continually before thee, O Lord my helper, and my redeemer.
