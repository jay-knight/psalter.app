# Psalm 151

<sup>1</sup> This Psalm is a genuine one of David, though supernumerary, composed when he fought in single combat with Goliad. I was small among my brethren, and youngest in my father's house: I tended my father's sheep. <sup>2</sup> My hands formed a musical instrument, and my fingers tuned a psaltery. <sup>3</sup> And who shall tell my Lord? the Lord himself, he himself hears. <sup>4</sup> He sent forth his angel, and took me from my father's sheep, and he anointed me with the oil of his anointing. <sup>5</sup> My brothers were handsome and tall; but the Lord did not take pleasure in them. <sup>6</sup> I went forth to meet the Philistine; and he cursed me by his idols. <sup>7</sup> But I drew his own sword, and beheaded him, and removed reproach from the children of Israel.
