<div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">1</sup> This Psalm is a genuine one of David, though supernumerary, composed when he fought in single combat with Goliad. I was small among my brethren, and youngest in my father's house: I tended my father's sheep. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">2</sup> My hands formed a musical instrument, and my fingers tuned a psaltery. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">3</sup> And who shall tell my Lord? the Lord himself, he himself hears. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">4</sup> He sent forth his angel, and took me from my father's sheep, and he anointed me with the oil of his anointing. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">5</sup> My brothers were handsome and tall; but the Lord did not take pleasure in them. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">6</sup> I went forth to meet the Philistine; and he cursed me by his idols. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">7</sup> But I drew his own sword, and beheaded him, and removed reproach from the children of Israel. </div>
