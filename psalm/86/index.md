# Psalm 86

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of a Song for the sons of Core. His foundations are in the holy mountains. <sup>2</sup> The Lord loves the gates of Sion, more than all the tabernacles of Jacob. <sup>3</sup> Glorious things have been spoken of thee, O city of God. Pause. <sup>4</sup> I will make mention of Raab and Babylon to them that know me: behold also the Philistines, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians: these were born there. <sup>5</sup> A man shall say, Sion is my mother; and such a man was born in her; and the Highest himself has founded her. <sup>6</sup> The Lord shall recount it in the writing of the people, and of these princes that were born in her. Pause. <sup>7</sup> The dwelling of all within thee is as the dwelling of those that rejoice.
