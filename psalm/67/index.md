# Psalm 67

<sup>1</sup> For the end, a Psalm of a Song by David. <sup>2</sup> Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered; and let them that hate him flee from before him. <sup>3</sup> As smoke vanishes, let them vanish: as wax melts before the fire, so let the sinners perish from before God. <sup>4</sup> But let the righteous rejoice; let them exult before God: let them be delighted with joy. <sup>5</sup> Sing to God, sing praises to his name: make a way for him that rides upon the west (the Lord is his name) and exult before him. They shall be troubled before the face of him, <sup>6</sup> who is the father of the orphans, and judge of the widows: such is God in his holy place. <sup>7</sup> God settles the solitary in a house; leading forth prisoners mightily, also them that act provokingly, even them that dwell in tombs. <sup>8</sup> O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou wentest through the wilderness; Pause: <sup>9</sup> the earth quaked, yea, the heavens dropped water at the presence of the God of Sina, at the presence of the God of Israel. <sup>10</sup> O God, thou wilt grant to thine inheritance a gracious rain; for it was weary, but thou didst refresh it. <sup>11</sup> Thy creatures dwell in it: thou hast in thy goodness prepared for the poor. <sup>12</sup> The Lord God will give a word to them that preach it in a great company. <sup>13</sup> The king of the forces of the beloved, of the beloved, will even grant them for the beauty of the house to divide the spoils. <sup>14</sup> Even if ye should lie among the lots, ye shall have the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her breast with yellow gold. <sup>15</sup> When the heavenly One scatters kings upon it, they shall be made snow-white in Selmon. <sup>16</sup> The mountain of God is a rich mountain; a swelling mountain, a rich mountain. <sup>17</sup> Wherefore do ye conceive evil, ye swelling mountains? this is the mountain which God has delighted to dwell in; yea, the Lord will dwell in it for ever. <sup>18</sup> The chariots of God are ten thousand fold, thousands of rejoicing ones: the Lord is among them, in Sina, in the holy place. <sup>19</sup> Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, thou hast received gifts for man, yea, for they were rebellious, that thou mightest dwell among them. <sup>20</sup> Blessed be the Lord God, blessed be the Lord daily; and the God of our salvation shall prosper us. Pause. <sup>21</sup> Our God is the God of salvation; and to the Lord belong the issues from death. <sup>22</sup> But God shall crush the heads of his enemies; the hairy crown of them that go on in their trespasses. <sup>23</sup> The Lord said, I will bring again from Basan, I will bring my people again through the depths of the sea. <sup>24</sup> That thy foot may be dipped in blood, and the tongue of thy dogs be stained with that of thine enemies. <sup>25</sup> Thy goings, O God, have been seen; the goings of my God, the king, in the sanctuary. <sup>26</sup> The princes went first, next before the players on instruments, in the midst of damsels playing on timbrels. <sup>27</sup> Praise God in the congregations, the Lord from the fountains of Israel. <sup>28</sup> There is Benjamin the younger one in ecstasy, the princes of Juda their rulers, the princes of Zabulon, the princes of Nephthali. <sup>29</sup> O God, command thou thy strength: strengthen, O God, this which thou hast wrought in us. <sup>30</sup> Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents to thee. <sup>31</sup> Rebuke the wild beasts of the reed: let the crowd of bulls with the heifers of the nations be rebuked, so that they who have been proved with silver may not be shut out: scatter thou the nations that wish for wars. <sup>32</sup> Ambassadors shall arrive out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall hasten to stretch out her hand readily to God. <sup>33</sup> Sing to God, ye kingdoms of the earth; sing psalms to the Lord. Pause. <sup>34</sup> Sing to God that rides on the heaven of heaven, eastward: lo, he will utter a mighty sound with his voice. <sup>35</sup> Give ye glory to God: his excellency is over Israel, and his power is in the clouds. <sup>36</sup> God is wonderful in his holy places, the God of Israel: he will give power and strength to his people: blessed be God.
