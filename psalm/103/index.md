# Psalm 103

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, thou art very great; thou hast clothed thyself with praise and honour: <sup>2</sup> who dost robe thyself with light as with a garment; spreading out the heaven as a curtain. <sup>3</sup> Who covers his chambers with waters; who makes the clouds his chariot; who walks on the wings of the wind. <sup>4</sup> Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flaming fire. <sup>5</sup> Who establishes the earth on her sure foundation: it shall not be moved for ever. <sup>6</sup> The deep, as it were a garment, is his covering: the waters shall stand on the hills. <sup>7</sup> At thy rebuke they shall flee; at the voice of thy thunder they shall be alarmed. <sup>8</sup> They go up to the mountains, and down to the plains, to the place which thou hast founded for them. <sup>9</sup> Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass, neither shall they turn again to cover the earth. <sup>10</sup> He sends forth his fountains among the valleys: the waters shall run between the mountains. <sup>11</sup> They shall give drink to all the wild beasts of the field: the wild asses shall take of them to quench their thirst. <sup>12</sup> By them shall the birds of the sky lodge: they shall utter a voice out of the midst of the rocks. <sup>13</sup> He waters the mountains from his chambers: the earth shall be satisfied with the fruit of thy works. <sup>14</sup> He makes grass to grow for the cattle, and green herb for the service of men, to bring bread out of the earth; <sup>15</sup> and wine makes glad the heart of man, to make his face cheerful with oil: and bread strengthens man's heart. <sup>16</sup> The trees of the plain shall be full of sap; even the cedars of Libanus which he has planted. <sup>17</sup> There the sparrows will build their nests; and the house of the heron takes the lead among them. <sup>18</sup> The high mountains are a refuge for the stags, and the rock for the rabbits. <sup>19</sup> He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knows his going down. <sup>20</sup> Thou didst make darkness, and it was night; in it all the wild beasts of the forest will be abroad: <sup>21</sup> even young lions roaring for prey, and to seek meat for themselves from God. <sup>22</sup> The sun arises, and they shall be gathered together, and shall lie down in their dens. <sup>23</sup> Man shall go forth to his work, and to his labour till evening. <sup>24</sup> How great are thy works, O Lord! in wisdom hast thou wrought them all: the earth is filled with thy creation. <sup>25</sup> So is this great and wide sea: there are things creeping innumerable, small animals and great. <sup>26</sup> There go the ships; and this dragon whom thou hast made to play in it. <sup>27</sup> All wait upon thee, to give them their food in due season. <sup>28</sup> When thou hast given it them, they will gather it; and when thou hast opened thine hand, they shall all be filled with good. <sup>29</sup> But when thou hast turned away thy face, they shall be troubled: thou wilt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and return to their dust. <sup>30</sup> Thou shalt send forth thy Spirit, and they shall be created; and thou shalt renew the face of the earth. <sup>31</sup> Let the glory of the Lord be for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in his works; <sup>32</sup> who looks upon the earth, and makes it tremble; who touches the mountains, and they smoke. <sup>33</sup> I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will sing praise to my God while I exist. <sup>34</sup> Let my meditation be sweet to him: and I will rejoice in the Lord. <sup>35</sup> Let the sinners fail from off the earth, and transgressors, so that they shall be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul.
