# Psalm 89

<sup>1</sup> A Prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our refuge in all generations. <sup>2</sup> Before the mountains existed, and before the earth and the world were formed, even from age to age, Thou art. <sup>3</sup> Turn not man back to his low place, whereas thou saidst, Return, ye sons of men? <sup>4</sup> For a thousand years in thy sight are as the yesterday which is past, and as a watch in the night. <sup>5</sup> Years shall be vanity to them: let the morning pass away as grass. <sup>6</sup> In the morning let it flower, and pass away: in the evening let it droop, let it be withered and dried up. <sup>7</sup> For we have perished in thine anger, and in thy wrath we have been troubled. <sup>8</sup> Thou hast set our transgressions before thee: our age is in the light of thy countenance. <sup>9</sup> For all our days are gone, and we have passed away in thy wrath: our years have spun out their tale as a spider. <sup>10</sup> As for the days of our years, in them are seventy years; and if men should be in strength, eighty years: and the greater part of them would be labour and trouble; for weakness overtakes us, and we shall be chastened. <sup>11</sup> Who knows the power of thy wrath? <sup>12</sup> and who knows how to number his days because of the fear of thy wrath? So manifest thy right hand, and those that are instructed in wisdom in the heart. <sup>13</sup> Return, O Lord, how long? and be intreated concerning thy servants. <sup>14</sup> We have been satisfied in the morning with thy mercy; and we did exult and rejoice: <sup>15</sup> let us rejoice in all our days, in return for the days wherein thou didst afflict us, the years wherein we saw evil. <sup>16</sup> And look upon thy servants, and upon thy works; and guide their children. <sup>17</sup> And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us: and do thou direct for us the works of our hands.
