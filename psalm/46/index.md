# Psalm 46

<sup>1</sup> For the end, a Psalm for the sons of Core. <sup>2</sup> Clap your hands, all ye nations; shout to God with a voice of exultation. <sup>3</sup> For the Lord most high is terrible; he is a great king over all the earth. <sup>4</sup> He has subdued the peoples under us, and the nations under our feet. <sup>5</sup> He has chosen out his inheritance for us, the beauty of Jacob which he loved. Pause. <sup>6</sup> God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with a sound of a trumpet. <sup>7</sup> Sing praises to our God, sing praises: sing praises to our King, sing praises. <sup>8</sup> For God is king of all the earth: sing praises with understanding. <sup>9</sup> God reigns over the nations: God sits upon the throne of his holiness. <sup>10</sup> The rulers of the people are assembled with the God of Abraam: for God's mighty ones of the earth have been greatly exalted.
