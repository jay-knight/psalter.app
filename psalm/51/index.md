All the day </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">4</sup> thy tongue has devised unrighteousness; like a sharpened razor thou hast wrought deceit. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">5</sup> Thou hast loved wickedness more than goodness; unrighteousness better than to speak righteousness. Pause. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">6</sup> Thou hast loved all words of destruction, and a deceitful tongue. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">7</sup> Therefore may God destroy thee for ever, may he pluck thee up and utterly remove thee from thy dwelling, and thy root from the land of the living.
