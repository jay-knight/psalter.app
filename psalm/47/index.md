# Psalm 47

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of praise for the sons of Core on the second day of the week. <sup>2</sup> Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain. <sup>3</sup> The city of the great King is well planted on the mountains of Sion, with the joy of the whole earth, on the sides of the north. <sup>4</sup> God is known in her palaces, when he undertakes to help her. <sup>5</sup> For, behold, the kings of the earth were assembled, they came together. <sup>6</sup> They saw, and so they wondered: they were troubled, they were moved. <sup>7</sup> Trembling took hold on them: there were the pangs as of a woman in travail. <sup>8</sup> Thou wilt break the ships of Tharsis with a vehement wind. <sup>9</sup> As we have heard, so have we also seen, in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God has founded it for ever. Pause. <sup>10</sup> We have thought of thy mercy, O God, in the midst of thy people. <sup>11</sup> According to thy name, O God, so is also thy praise to the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness. <sup>12</sup> Let mount Sion rejoice, let the daughters of Jud√¶a exult, because of thy judgments, O Lord. <sup>13</sup> Go round about Sion, and encompass her: tell ye her towers. <sup>14</sup> Mark ye well her strength, and observe her palaces; that ye may tell the next generation. <sup>15</sup> For this is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide for evermore.
