# Psalm 69

<sup>1</sup> For the end, by David for a remembrance, that the Lord may save me. <sup>2</sup> Draw nigh, O God, to my help. <sup>3</sup> Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek my soul: let them be turned backward and put to shame, that wish me evil. <sup>4</sup> Let them that say to me, Aha, aha, be turned back and put to shame immediately. <sup>5</sup> Let all that seek thee exult and be glad in thee: and let those that love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. <sup>6</sup> But I am poor and needy; O God, help me: thou art my helper and deliverer, O Lord, delay not.
