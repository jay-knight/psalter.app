Unto thee who dwellest in heaven have I lifted up mine eyes. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">2</sup> Behold, as the eyes of servants are directed to the hands of their masters, and as the eyes of a maid-servant to the hands of her mistress; so our eyes are directed to the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">3</sup> Have pity upon us, O Lord, have pity upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">4</sup> Yea, our soul has been exceedingly filled with it: let the reproach be to them that are at ease, and contempt to the proud. </div>
