# Psalm 122

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Degrees. Unto thee who dwellest in heaven have I lifted up mine eyes. <sup>2</sup> Behold, as the eyes of servants are directed to the hands of their masters, and as the eyes of a maid-servant to the hands of her mistress; so our eyes are directed to the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us. <sup>3</sup> Have pity upon us, O Lord, have pity upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. <sup>4</sup> Yea, our soul has been exceedingly filled with it: let the reproach be to them that are at ease, and contempt to the proud.
