# Psalm 62

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Idumea. <sup>2</sup> O God, my God, I cry to thee early; my soul has thirsted for thee: how often has my flesh longed after thee, in a barren and trackless and dry land! <sup>3</sup> Thus have I appeared before thee in the sanctuary, that I might see thy power and thy glory. <sup>4</sup> For thy mercy is better than life: my lips shall praise thee. <sup>5</sup> Thus will I bless thee during my life: I will lift up my hands in thy name. <sup>6</sup> Let my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness; and my joyful lips shall praise thy name. <sup>7</sup> Forasmuch as I have remembered thee on my bed: in the early seasons I have meditated on thee. <sup>8</sup> For thou hast been my helper, and in the shelter of thy wings will I rejoice. <sup>9</sup> My soul has kept very close behind thee: thy right hand has upheld me. <sup>10</sup> But they vainly sought after my soul; they shall go into the lowest parts of the earth. <sup>11</sup> They shall be delivered up to the power of the sword; they shall be portions for foxes. <sup>12</sup> But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that swears by him shall be praised; for the mouth of them that speak unjust things has been stopped.
