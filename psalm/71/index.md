# Psalm 71

<sup>1</sup> For Solomon. O God, give thy judgment to the king, and thy righteousness to the king's son; <sup>2</sup> that he may judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment. <sup>3</sup> Let the mountains and the hills raise peace to thy people: <sup>4</sup> he shall judge the poor of the people in righteousness, and save the children of the needy; and shall bring low the false accuser. <sup>5</sup> And he shall continue as long as the sun, and before the moon for ever. <sup>6</sup> He shall come down as rain upon a fleece; and as drops falling upon the earth. <sup>7</sup> In his days shall righteousness spring up; and abundance of peace till the moon be removed. <sup>8</sup> And he shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth. <sup>9</sup> The Ethiopians shall fall down before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust. <sup>10</sup> The kings of Tharsis, and the isles, shall bring presents: the kings of the Arabians and Saba shall offer gifts. <sup>11</sup> And all kings shall worship him; all the Gentiles shall serve him. <sup>12</sup> For he has delivered the poor from the oppressor; and the needy who had no helper. <sup>13</sup> He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall deliver the souls of the needy. <sup>14</sup> He shall redeem their souls from usury and injustice: and their name shall be precious before him. <sup>15</sup> And he shall live, and there shall be given him of the gold of Arabia: and men shall pray for him continually; and all the day shall they praise him. <sup>16</sup> There shall be an establishment on the earth on the tops of the mountains: the fruit thereof shall be exalted above Libanus, and they of the city shall flourish as grass of the earth. <sup>17</sup> Let his name be blessed for ever: his name shall endure longer than the sun: and all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed. <sup>18</sup> Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, who alone does wonders. <sup>19</sup> And blessed is his glorious name for ever, even for ever and ever: and all the earth shall be filled with his glory. So be it, so be it. <sup>20</sup> The hymns of David the son of Jess√¶ are ended.
