They have corrupted themselves, and become abominable in iniquities: there is none that does good. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">3</sup> God looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any that understood, or sought after God. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">4</sup> They have all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does good, there is not even one. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">5</sup> Will none of the workers of iniquity know, who devour my people as they would eat bread? they have not called upon God. There were they greatly afraid, where there was no fear: </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">6</sup> for God has scattered the bones of the men-pleasers; they were ashamed, for God despised them. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">7</sup> Who will bring the salvation of Israel out of Sion?
