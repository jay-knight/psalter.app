# Psalm 128

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Degrees. Many a time have they warred against me from my youth, let Israel now say: <sup>2</sup> Many a time have they warred against me from my youth: and yet they prevailed not against me. <sup>3</sup> The sinners wrought upon my back: they prolonged their iniquity. <sup>4</sup> The righteous Lord has cut asunder the necks of sinners. <sup>5</sup> Let all that hate Sion be put to shame and turned back. <sup>6</sup> Let them be as the grass of the house-tops, which withers before it is plucked up. <sup>7</sup> Wherewith the reaper fills not his hand, nor he that makes up the sheaves, his bosom. <sup>8</sup> Neither do they that go by say, The blessing of the Lord be upon you: we have blessed you in the name of the Lord.
