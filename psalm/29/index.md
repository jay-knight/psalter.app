# Psalm 29

<sup>1</sup> For the end, a Psalm and Song at the dedication of the house of David. <sup>2</sup> I will exalt thee, O Lord; for thou hast lifted me up, and not caused mine enemies to rejoice over me. <sup>3</sup> O Lord my God, I cried to thee, and thou didst heal me. <sup>4</sup> O Lord, thou hast brought up my soul from Hades, thou hast delivered me from among them that go down to the pit. <sup>5</sup> Sing to the Lord, ye his saints, and give thanks for the remembrance of his holiness. <sup>6</sup> For anger is in his wrath, but life in his favour: weeping shall tarry for the evening, but joy shall be in the morning. <sup>7</sup> And I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved. <sup>8</sup> O Lord, in thy good pleasure thou didst add strength to my beauty: but thou didst turn away thy face, and I was troubled. <sup>9</sup> To thee, O Lord, will I cry; and to my God will I make supplication. <sup>10</sup> What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to destruction? Shall the dust give praise to thee? or shall it declare thy truth? <sup>11</sup> The Lord heard, and had compassion upon me; the Lord is become my helper. <sup>12</sup> Thou hast turned my mourning into joy for me: thou hast rent off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness; <sup>13</sup> that my glory may sing praise to thee, and I may not be pierced with sorrow. O Lord my God, I will give thanks to thee for ever.
