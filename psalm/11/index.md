# Psalm 11

<sup>1</sup> For the end, a Psalm of David, upon the eighth. <sup>2</sup> Save me, O Lord; for the godly man has failed; for truth is diminished from among the children of men. <sup>3</sup> Every one has spoken vanity to his neighbour: their lips are deceitful, they have spoken with a double heart. <sup>4</sup> Let the Lord destroy all the deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaks great words: <sup>5</sup> who have said, We will magnify our tongue; our lips are our own: who is Lord of us? <sup>6</sup> Because of the misery of the poor, and because of the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord, I will set them in safety; I will speak to them thereof openly. <sup>7</sup> The oracles of the Lord are pure oracles; as silver tried in the fire, proved in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. <sup>8</sup> Thou, O Lord, shalt keep us, and shalt preserve us, from this generation, and for ever. <sup>9</sup> The ungodly walk around: according to thy greatness thou hast greatly exalted the sons of men.
