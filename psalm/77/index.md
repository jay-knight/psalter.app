<div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">1</sup> A Psalm of instruction for Asaph. Give heed, O my people, to my law: incline your ear to the words of my mouth. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">2</sup> I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter dark sayings which have been from the beginning. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">3</sup> All which we have heard and known, and our fathers have declared to us. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">4</sup> They were not hid from their children to a second generation; the fathers declaring the praises of the Lord, and his mighty acts, and his wonders which he wrought. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">5</sup> And he raised up a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, to make it known to their children: </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">6</sup> that another generation might know, even the sons which should be born; and they should arise and declare them to their children. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">7</sup> That they might set their hope on God, and not forget the works of God, but diligently seek his commandments. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">8</sup> That they should not be as their fathers, a perverse and provoking generation; a generation which set not its heart aright, and its spirit was not steadfast with God. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">9</sup> The children of Ephraim, bending and shooting with the bow, turned back in the day of battle. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">10</sup> They kept not the covenant of God, and would not walk in his law. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">11</sup> And they forgot his benefits, and his miracles which he had shewed them; </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">12</sup> the miracles which he wrought before their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the plain of Tanes. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">13</sup> He clave the sea, and led them through: he made the waters to stand as in a bottle. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">14</sup> And he guided them with a cloud by day, and all the night with a light of fire. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">15</sup> He clave a rock in the wilderness, and made them drink as in a great deep. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">16</sup> And he brought water out of the rock, and caused waters to flow down as rivers. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">17</sup> And they sinned yet more against him; they provoked the Most High in the wilderness. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">18</sup> And they tempted God in their hearts, in asking meat for the desire of their souls. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">19</sup> They spoke also against God, and said, Will God be able to prepare a table in the wilderness? </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">20</sup> Forasmuch as he smote the rock, and the waters flowed, and the torrents ran abundantly; will he be able also to give bread, or prepare a table for his people? </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">21</sup> Therefore the Lord heard, and was provoked: and fire was kindled in Jacob, and wrath went up against Israel. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">22</sup> Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">23</sup> Yet he commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">24</sup> and rained upon them manna to eat, and gave them the bread of heaven. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">25</sup> Man ate angels' bread; he sent them provision to the full. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">26</sup> He removed the south wind from heaven; and by his might he brought in the south-west wind. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">27</sup> And he rained upon them flesh like dust, and feathered birds like the sand of the seas. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">28</sup> And they fell into the midst of their camp, round about their tents. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">29</sup> So they ate, and were completely filled; and he gave them their desire. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">30</sup> They were not disappointed of their desire: but when their food was yet in their mouth, </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">31</sup> then the indignation of God rose up against them, and slew the fattest of them, and overthrew the choice men of Israel. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">32</sup> In the midst of all this they sinned yet more, and believed not his miracles. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">33</sup> And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years with anxiety. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">34</sup> When he slew them, they sought him: and they returned and called betimes upon God. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">35</sup> And they remembered that God was their helper, and the most high God was their redeemer. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">36</sup> Yet they loved him only with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">37</sup> For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">38</sup> But he is compassionate, and will forgive their sins, and will not destroy them: yea, he will frequently turn away his wrath, and will not kindle all his anger. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">39</sup> And he remembered that they are flesh; a wind that passes away, and returns not. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">40</sup> How often did they provoke him in the wilderness, and anger him in a dry land! </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">41</sup> Yea, they turned back, and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">42</sup> They remembered not his hand, the day in which he delivered them from the hand of the oppressor. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">43</sup> How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanes: </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">44</sup> and had changed their rivers into blood; and their streams, that they should not drink. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">45</sup> He sent against them the dog-fly, and it devoured them; and the frog, and it spoiled them. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">46</sup> And he gave their fruit to the canker worm, and their labours to the locust. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">47</sup> He killed their vines with hail, and their sycamores with frost. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">48</sup> And he gave up their cattle to hail, and their substance to the fire. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">49</sup> He sent out against them the fury of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and affliction, a message by evil angels. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">50</sup> He made a way for his wrath; he spared not their souls from death, but consigned their cattle to death; </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">51</sup> and smote every first-born in the land of Egypt; the first-fruits of their labours in the tents of Cham. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">52</sup> And he removed his people like sheep; he led them as a flock in the wilderness. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">53</sup> And he guided them with hope, and they feared not: but the sea covered their enemies. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">54</sup> And he brought them in to the mountain of his sanctuary, this mountain which his right hand had purchased. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">55</sup> And he cast out the nations from before them, and made them to inherit by a line of inheritance, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">56</sup> Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">57</sup> And they turned back, and broke covenant, even as also their fathers: they became like a crooked bow. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">58</sup> And they provoked him with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">59</sup> God heard and lightly regarded them, and greatly despised Israel. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">60</sup> And he rejected the tabernacle of Selom, his tent where he dwelt among men. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">61</sup> And he gave their strength into captivity, and their beauty into the enemy's hand. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">62</sup> And he gave his people to the sword; and disdained his inheritance. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">63</sup> Fire devoured their young men; and their virgins mourned not. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">64</sup> Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows shall not be wept for. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">65</sup> So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and as a mighty man who has been heated with wine. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">66</sup> And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he brought on them a perpetual reproach. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">67</sup> And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim; </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">68</sup> but chose the tribe of Juda, the mount Sion which he loved. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">69</sup> And he built his sanctuary as the place of unicorns; he founded it for ever on the earth. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">70</sup> He chose David also his servant, and took him up from the flocks of sheep. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">71</sup> He took him from following the ewes great with young, to be the shepherd of Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">72</sup> So he tended them in the innocency of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands. </div>
