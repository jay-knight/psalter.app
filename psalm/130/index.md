<div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">1</sup> A Song of Degrees. O Lord, my heart is not exalted, neither have mine eyes been haughtily raised: neither have I exercised myself in great matters, nor in things too wonderful for me. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">2</sup> I shall have sinned if I have not been humble, but have exalted my soul: according to the relation of a weaned child to his mother, so wilt thou recompense my soul. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">3</sup> Let Israel hope in the Lord, from henceforth and for ever. </div>
