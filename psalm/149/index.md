# Psalm 149

<sup>1</sup> Alleluia. Sing to the Lord a new song: his praise is in the assembly of the saints. <sup>2</sup> Let Israel rejoice in him that made him; and let the children of Sion exult in their king. <sup>3</sup> Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises to him with timbrel and psaltery. <sup>4</sup> For the Lord takes pleasure in his people; and will exalt the meek with salvation. <sup>5</sup> The saints shall rejoice in glory; and shall exult on their beds. <sup>6</sup> The high praises of God shall be in their throat, and two-edged swords in their hands; <sup>7</sup> to execute vengeance on the nations, and punishments among the peoples; <sup>8</sup> to bind their kings with fetters, and their nobles with manacles of iron; <sup>9</sup> to execute on them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints.
