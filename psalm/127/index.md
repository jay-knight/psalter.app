# Psalm 127

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Degrees. Blessed are all they that fear the Lord; who walk in his ways. <sup>2</sup> Thou shalt eat the labours of thy hands: blessed art thou, and it shall be well with thee. <sup>3</sup> Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine on the sides of thy house: thy children as young olive-plants round about thy table. <sup>4</sup> Behold, thus shall the man be blessed that fears the Lord. <sup>5</sup> May the Lord bless thee out of Sion; and mayest thou see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. <sup>6</sup> And mayest thou see thy children's children. Peace be upon Israel.
