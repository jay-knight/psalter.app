# Psalm 120

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Degrees. I lifted up mine eyes to the mountains, whence my help shall come. <sup>2</sup> My help shall come from the Lord, who made the heaven and the earth. <sup>3</sup> Let not thy foot be moved; and let not thy keeper slumber. <sup>4</sup> Behold, he that keeps Israel shall not slumber nor sleep. <sup>5</sup> The Lord shall keep thee: the Lord is thy shelter upon thy right hand. <sup>6</sup> The sun shall not burn thee by day, neither the moon by night. <sup>7</sup> May the Lord preserve thee from all evil: the Lord shall keep thy soul. <sup>8</sup> The Lord shall keep thy coming in, and thy going out, from henceforth and even for ever.
