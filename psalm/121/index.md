# Psalm 121

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Degrees. I was glad when they said to me, Let us go into the house of the Lord. <sup>2</sup> Our feet stood in thy courts, O Jerusalem. <sup>3</sup> Jerusalem is built as a city whose fellowship is complete. <sup>4</sup> For thither the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord, as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord. <sup>5</sup> For there are set thrones for judgment, even thrones for the house of David. <sup>6</sup> Pray now for the peace of Jerusalem: and let there be prosperity to them that love thee. <sup>7</sup> Let peace, I pray, be within thine host, and prosperity in thy palaces. <sup>8</sup> For the sake of my brethren and my neighbours, I have indeed spoken peace concerning thee. <sup>9</sup> Because of the house of the Lord our God, I have diligently sought thy good.
