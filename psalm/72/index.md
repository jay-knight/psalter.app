<div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">1</sup> A Psalm for Asaph. How good is God to Israel, to the upright in heart! </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">2</sup> But my feet were almost overthrown; my goings very nearly slipped. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">3</sup> For I was jealous of the transgressors, beholding the tranquillity of sinners. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">4</sup> For there is no sign of reluctance in their death: and they have firmness under their affliction. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">5</sup> They are not in the troubles of other men; and they shall not be scourged with other men. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">6</sup> Therefore pride has possessed them; they have clothed themselves with their injustice and ungodliness. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">7</sup> Their injustice shall go forth as out of fatness: they have fulfilled their intention. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">8</sup> They have taken counsel and spoken in wickedness: they have uttered unrighteousness loftily. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">9</sup> They have set their mouth against heaven, and their tongue has gone through upon the earth. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">10</sup> Therefore shall my people return hither: and full days shall be found with them. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">11</sup> And they said, How does God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High? </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">12</sup> Behold, these are the sinners, and they that prosper always: they have possessed wealth. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">13</sup> And I said, Verily in vain have I justified my heart, and washed my hands in innocency. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">14</sup> For I was plagued all the day, and my reproof was every morning. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">15</sup> If I said, I will speak thus; behold, I should have broken covenant with the generation of thy children. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">16</sup> And I undertook to understand this, but it is too hard for me, </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">17</sup> until I go into the sanctuary of God; and so understand the latter end. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">18</sup> Surely thou hast appointed judgments to them because of their crafty dealings: thou hast cast them down when they were lifted up. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">19</sup> How have they become desolate! suddenly they have failed: they have perished because of their iniquity. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">20</sup> As the dream of one awakening, O Lord, in thy city thou wilt despise their image. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">21</sup> For my heart has rejoiced, and my reins have been gladdened. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">22</sup> But I was vile and knew not: I became brutish before thee. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">23</sup> Yet I am continually with thee: thou hast holden my right hand. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">24</sup> Thou hast guided me by thy counsel, and thou hast taken me to thyself with glory. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">25</sup> For what have I in heaven but thee? and what have I desired upon the earth beside thee? </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">26</sup> My heart and my flesh have failed: but God is the strength of my heart, and God is my portion for ever. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">27</sup> For, behold, they that remove themselves far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed every one that goes a whoring from thee. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">28</sup> But it is good for me to cleave close to God, to put my trust in the Lord; that I may proclaim all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion. </div>
