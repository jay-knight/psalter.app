<div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">1</sup> A Psalm of instruction by David. Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">2</sup> Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin, and in whose mouth there is no guile. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">3</sup> Because I kept silence, my bones waxed old, from my crying all the day. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">4</sup> For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: I became thoroughly miserable while a thorn was fastened in me. Pause. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">5</sup> I acknowledged my sin, and hid not mine iniquity: I said, I will confess mine iniquity to the Lord against myself; and thou forgavest the ungodliness of my heart. Pause. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">6</sup> Therefore shall every holy one pray to thee in a fit time: only in the deluge of many waters they shall not come nigh to him. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">7</sup> Thou art my refuge from the affliction that encompasses me; my joy, to deliver me from them that have compassed me. Pause. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">8</sup> I will instruct thee and guide thee in this way wherein thou shalt go: I will fix mine eyes upon thee. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">9</sup> Be ye not as horse and mule, which have no understanding: but thou must constrain their jaws with bit and curb, lest they should come nigh to thee. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">10</sup> Many are the scourges of the sinner: but him that hopes in the Lord mercy shall compass about. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">11</sup> Be glad in the Lord, and exult, ye righteous: and glory, all ye that are upright in heart. </div>
