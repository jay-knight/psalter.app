# Psalm 31

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of instruction by David. Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. <sup>2</sup> Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin, and in whose mouth there is no guile. <sup>3</sup> Because I kept silence, my bones waxed old, from my crying all the day. <sup>4</sup> For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: I became thoroughly miserable while a thorn was fastened in me. Pause. <sup>5</sup> I acknowledged my sin, and hid not mine iniquity: I said, I will confess mine iniquity to the Lord against myself; and thou forgavest the ungodliness of my heart. Pause. <sup>6</sup> Therefore shall every holy one pray to thee in a fit time: only in the deluge of many waters they shall not come nigh to him. <sup>7</sup> Thou art my refuge from the affliction that encompasses me; my joy, to deliver me from them that have compassed me. Pause. <sup>8</sup> I will instruct thee and guide thee in this way wherein thou shalt go: I will fix mine eyes upon thee. <sup>9</sup> Be ye not as horse and mule, which have no understanding: but thou must constrain their jaws with bit and curb, lest they should come nigh to thee. <sup>10</sup> Many are the scourges of the sinner: but him that hopes in the Lord mercy shall compass about. <sup>11</sup> Be glad in the Lord, and exult, ye righteous: and glory, all ye that are upright in heart.
