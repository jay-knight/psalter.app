<div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">1</sup> For the end, among Hymns of instruction by David. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">2</sup> Hearken, O God, to my prayer; and disregard not my supplication. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">3</sup> Attend to me, and hearken to me: I was grieved in my meditation, and troubled; </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">4</sup> because of the voice of the enemy, and because of the oppression of the sinner: for they brought iniquity against me, and were wrathfully angry with me. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">5</sup> My heart was troubled within me; and the fear of death fell upon me. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">6</sup> Fear and trembling came upon me, and darkness covered me. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">7</sup> And I said, O that I had wings as those of a dove! then would I flee away, and be at rest. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">8</sup> Lo! I have fled afar off, and lodged in the wilderness. Pause. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">9</sup> I waited for him that should deliver me from distress of spirit and tempest. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">10</sup> Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen iniquity and gainsaying in the city. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">11</sup> Day and night he shall go round about it upon its walls: iniquity and sorrow and unrighteousness are in the midst of it; </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">12</sup> and usury and craft have not failed from its streets. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">13</sup> For if an enemy had reproached me, I would have endured it; and if one who hated me had spoken vauntingly against me, I would have hid myself from him. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">14</sup> But thou, O man likeminded, my guide, and my acquaintance, </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">15</sup> who in companionship with me sweetened our food: we walked in the house of God in concord. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">16</sup> Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into Hades, for iniquity is in their dwellings, in the midst of them. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">17</sup> I cried to God, and the Lord hearkened to me. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">18</sup> Evening, and morning, and at noon I will declare and make known my wants: and he shall hear my voice. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">19</sup> He shall deliver my soul in peace from them that draw nigh to me: for they were with me in many cases. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">20</sup> God shall hear, and bring them low, even he that has existed from eternity. Pause. For they suffer no reverse, and therefore they have not feared God. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">21</sup> He has reached forth his hand for retribution; they have profaned his covenant. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">22</sup> They were scattered at the anger of his countenance, and his heart drew nigh them. His words were smoother than oil, yet are they darts. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">23</sup> Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee; he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">24</sup> But thou, O God, shalt bring them down to the pit of destruction; bloody and crafty men shall not live out half their days; but I will hope in thee, O Lord. </div>
