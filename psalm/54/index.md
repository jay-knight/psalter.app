# Psalm 54

<sup>1</sup> For the end, among Hymns of instruction by David. <sup>2</sup> Hearken, O God, to my prayer; and disregard not my supplication. <sup>3</sup> Attend to me, and hearken to me: I was grieved in my meditation, and troubled; <sup>4</sup> because of the voice of the enemy, and because of the oppression of the sinner: for they brought iniquity against me, and were wrathfully angry with me. <sup>5</sup> My heart was troubled within me; and the fear of death fell upon me. <sup>6</sup> Fear and trembling came upon me, and darkness covered me. <sup>7</sup> And I said, O that I had wings as those of a dove! then would I flee away, and be at rest. <sup>8</sup> Lo! I have fled afar off, and lodged in the wilderness. Pause. <sup>9</sup> I waited for him that should deliver me from distress of spirit and tempest. <sup>10</sup> Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen iniquity and gainsaying in the city. <sup>11</sup> Day and night he shall go round about it upon its walls: iniquity and sorrow and unrighteousness are in the midst of it; <sup>12</sup> and usury and craft have not failed from its streets. <sup>13</sup> For if an enemy had reproached me, I would have endured it; and if one who hated me had spoken vauntingly against me, I would have hid myself from him. <sup>14</sup> But thou, O man likeminded, my guide, and my acquaintance, <sup>15</sup> who in companionship with me sweetened our food: we walked in the house of God in concord. <sup>16</sup> Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into Hades, for iniquity is in their dwellings, in the midst of them. <sup>17</sup> I cried to God, and the Lord hearkened to me. <sup>18</sup> Evening, and morning, and at noon I will declare and make known my wants: and he shall hear my voice. <sup>19</sup> He shall deliver my soul in peace from them that draw nigh to me: for they were with me in many cases. <sup>20</sup> God shall hear, and bring them low, even he that has existed from eternity. Pause. For they suffer no reverse, and therefore they have not feared God. <sup>21</sup> He has reached forth his hand for retribution; they have profaned his covenant. <sup>22</sup> They were scattered at the anger of his countenance, and his heart drew nigh them. His words were smoother than oil, yet are they darts. <sup>23</sup> Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee; he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. <sup>24</sup> But thou, O God, shalt bring them down to the pit of destruction; bloody and crafty men shall not live out half their days; but I will hope in thee, O Lord.
