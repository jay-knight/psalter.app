# Psalm 40

<sup>1</sup> For the end, a Psalm of David. <sup>2</sup> Blessed is the man who thinks on the poor and needy: the Lord shall deliver him in an evil day. <sup>3</sup> May the Lord preserve him and keep him alive, and bless him on the earth, and not deliver him into the hands of his enemy. <sup>4</sup> May the Lord help him upon the bed of his pain; thou hast made all his bed in his sickness. <sup>5</sup> I said, O Lord, have mercy upon me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee. <sup>6</sup> Mine enemies have spoken evil against me, saying, When shall he die, and his name perish? <sup>7</sup> And if he came to see me, his heart spoke vainly; he gathered iniquity to himself; he went forth and spoke in like manner. <sup>8</sup> All my enemies whispered against me; against me they devised my hurt. <sup>9</sup> They denounced a wicked word against me, saying, Now that he lies, shall he not rise up again? <sup>10</sup> For even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, lifted up his heel against me. <sup>11</sup> But thou, O Lord, have compassion upon me, and raise me up, and I shall requite them. <sup>12</sup> By this I know that thou hast delighted in me, because mine enemy shall not rejoice over me. <sup>13</sup> But thou didst help me because of mine innocence, and hast established me before thee for ever. <sup>14</sup> Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. So be it, so be it.
