# Psalm 3

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David, when he fled from the presence of his son Abessalom. <sup>2</sup> O Lord, why are they that afflict me multiplied? many rise up against me. <sup>3</sup> Many say concerning my soul, There is no deliverance for him in his God. Pause. <sup>4</sup> But thou, O Lord, art my helper: my glory, and the one that lifts up my head. <sup>5</sup> I cried to the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy mountain. Pause. <sup>6</sup> I lay down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord will help me. <sup>7</sup> I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, who beset me round about. <sup>8</sup> Arise, Lord; deliver me, my God: for thou hast smitten all who were without cause mine enemies; thou hast broken the teeth of sinners. <sup>9</sup> Deliverance is the Lord's, and thy blessing is upon thy people.
