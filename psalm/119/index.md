# Psalm 119

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Degrees. In mine affliction I cried to the Lord, and he hearkened to me. <sup>2</sup> Deliver my soul, O Lord, from unjust lips, and from a deceitful tongue. <sup>3</sup> What should be given to thee, and what should be added to thee, for thy crafty tongue? <sup>4</sup> Sharpened weapons of the mighty, with coals of the desert. <sup>5</sup> Woe is me, that my sojourning is prolonged; I have tabernacled among the tents of Kedar. <sup>6</sup> My soul has long been a sojourner; <sup>7</sup> I was peaceable among them that hated peace; when I spoke to them, they warred against me without a cause.
