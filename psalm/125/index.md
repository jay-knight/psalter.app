# Psalm 125

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Degrees. When the Lord turned the captivity of Sion, we became as comforted ones. <sup>2</sup> Then was our mouth filled with joy, and our tongue with exultation: then would they say among the Gentiles, <sup>3</sup> The Lord has done great things among them. The Lord has done great things for us, we became joyful. <sup>4</sup> Turn, O Lord, our captivity, as the streams in the south. <sup>5</sup> They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. <sup>6</sup> They went on and wept as they cast their seeds; but they shall surely come with exultation, bringing their sheaves with them.
