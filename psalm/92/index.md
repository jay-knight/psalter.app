# Psalm 92

<sup>1</sup> For the day before the Sabbath, when the land was first inhabited, the praise of a Song by David. The Lord reigns; he has clothed himself with honour: the Lord has clothed and girded himself with strength; for he has established the world, which shall not be moved. <sup>2</sup> Thy throne is prepared of old: thou art from everlasting. <sup>3</sup> The rivers have lifted up, O Lord, the rivers have lifted up their voices, <sup>4</sup> at the voices of many waters: the billows of the sea are wonderful: the Lord is wonderful in high places. <sup>5</sup> Thy testimonies are made very sure: holiness becomes thine house, O Lord, for ever.
