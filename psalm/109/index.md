# Psalm 109

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. <sup>2</sup> The Lord shall send out a rod of power for thee out of Sion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. <sup>3</sup> With thee is dominion in the day of thy power, in the splendours of thy saints: I have begotten thee from the womb before the morning. <sup>4</sup> The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec. <sup>5</sup> The Lord at thy right hand has dashed in pieces kings in the day of his wrath. <sup>6</sup> He shall judge among the nations, he shall fill up the number of corpses, he shall crush the heads of many on the earth. <sup>7</sup> He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore shall he lift up the head.
