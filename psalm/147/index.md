# Psalm 147

<sup>1</sup> Alleluia, a Psalm of Agg√¶us and Zacharias. Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Sion. <sup>2</sup> For he has strengthened the bars of thy gates; he has blessed thy children within thee. <sup>3</sup> He makes thy borders peaceful, and fills thee with the flour of wheat. <sup>4</sup> He sends his oracle to the earth: his word will run swiftly. <sup>5</sup> He gives snow like wool: he scatters the mist like ashes. <sup>6</sup> Casting forth his ice like morsels: who shall stand before his cold? <sup>7</sup> He shall send out his word, and melt them: he shall blow with his wind, and the waters shall flow. <sup>8</sup> He sends his word to Jacob, his ordinances and judgments to Israel. <sup>9</sup> He has not done so to any other nation; and he has not shewn them his judgments.
