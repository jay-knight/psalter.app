# Psalm 126

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Degrees. Except the Lord build the house, they that build labour in vain: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman watches in vain. <sup>2</sup> It is vain for you to rise early: ye rise up after resting, ye that eat the bread of grief; while he gives sleep to his beloved. <sup>3</sup> Behold, the inheritance of the Lord, children, the reward of the fruit of the womb. <sup>4</sup> As arrows in the hand of a mighty man; so are the children of those who were outcasts. <sup>5</sup> Blessed is the man who shall satisfy his desire with them: they shall not be ashamed when they shall speak to their enemies in the gates.
