# Psalm 60

<sup>1</sup> For the end, among the Hymns of David. <sup>2</sup> O God, hearken to my petition; attend to my prayer. <sup>3</sup> From the ends of the earth have I cried to thee, when my heart was in trouble: thou liftedst me up on a rock, thou didst guide me: <sup>4</sup> because thou wert my hope, a tower of strength from the face of the enemy. <sup>5</sup> I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever; I will shelter myself under the shadow of thy wings. Pause. <sup>6</sup> For thou, O God, hast heard my prayers; thou hast given an inheritance to them that fear thy name. <sup>7</sup> Thou shalt add days to the days of the king; thou shalt lengthen his years to all generations. <sup>8</sup> He shall endure for ever before God: which of them will seek out his mercy and truth? <sup>9</sup> So will I sing to thy name for ever and ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
