# Psalm 4

<sup>1</sup> For the end, a Song of David among the Psalms. <sup>2</sup> When I called upon him, the God of my righteousness heard me: thou hast made room for me in tribulation; pity me, and hearken to my prayer. <sup>3</sup> O ye sons of men, how long will ye be slow of heart? wherefore do ye love vanity, and seek falsehood? Pause. <sup>4</sup> But know ye that the Lord has done wondrous things for his holy one: the Lord will hear me when I cry to him. <sup>5</sup> Be ye angry, and sin not; feel compunction upon your beds for what ye say in your hearts. Pause. <sup>6</sup> Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, and trust in the Lord. <sup>7</sup> Many say, Who will shew us good things? the light of thy countenance, O Lord, has been manifested towards us. <sup>8</sup> Thou hast put gladness into my heart: they have been satisfied with the fruit of their corn and wine and oil. <sup>9</sup> I will both lie down in peace and sleep: for thou, Lord, only hast caused me to dwell securely.
