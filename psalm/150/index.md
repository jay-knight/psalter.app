# Psalm 150

<sup>1</sup> Alleluia. Praise God in his holy places: praise him in the firmament of his power. <sup>2</sup> Praise him on account of his mighty acts: praise him according to his abundant greatness. <sup>3</sup> Praise him with the sound of a trumpet: praise him with psaltery and harp. <sup>4</sup> Praise him with timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and the organ. <sup>5</sup> Praise him with melodious cymbals: praise him with loud cymbals. <sup>6</sup> Let every thing that has breath praise the Lord.
