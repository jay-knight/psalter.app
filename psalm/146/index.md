# Psalm 146

<sup>1</sup> Alleluia, a Psalm of Agg√¶us and Zacharias. Praise ye the Lord: for psalmody is a good thing; let praise be sweetly sung to our God. <sup>2</sup> The Lord builds up Jerusalem; and he will gather together the dispersed of Israel. <sup>3</sup> He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds. <sup>4</sup> He numbers the multitudes of stars; and calls them all by names. <sup>5</sup> Great is our Lord, and great is his strength; and his understanding is infinite. <sup>6</sup> The Lord lifts up the meek; but brings sinners down to the ground. <sup>7</sup> Begin the song with thanksgiving to the Lord; sing praises on the harp to our God: <sup>8</sup> who covers the heaven with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who causes grass to spring up on the mountains, and green herb for the service of men; <sup>9</sup> and gives to cattle their food, and to the young ravens that call upon him. <sup>10</sup> He will not take pleasure in the strength of a horse; neither is he well-pleased with the legs of a man. <sup>11</sup> The Lord takes pleasure in them that fear him, and in all that hope in his mercy.
