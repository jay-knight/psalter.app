# Psalm 94

<sup>1</sup> The praise of a Song by David. Come, let us exult in the Lord; let us make a joyful noise to God our Saviour. <sup>2</sup> Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise to him with psalms. <sup>3</sup> For the Lord is a great God, and a great king over all gods: for the Lord will not cast off his people. <sup>4</sup> For the ends of the earth are in his hands; and the heights of the mountains are his. <sup>5</sup> For the sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land. <sup>6</sup> Come, let us worship and fall down before him; and weep before the Lord that made us. <sup>7</sup> For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. <sup>8</sup> To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, according to the day of irritation in the wilderness: <sup>9</sup> where your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works. <sup>10</sup> Forty years was I grieved with this generation, and said, They do always err in their heart, and they have not known my ways. <sup>11</sup> So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.
