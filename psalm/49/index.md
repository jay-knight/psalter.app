<div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">1</sup> A Psalm for Asaph. The God of gods, the Lord, has spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">2</sup> Out of Sion comes the excellence of his beauty. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">3</sup> God, our God, shall come manifestly, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall be kindled before him, and round about him there shall be a very great tempest. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">4</sup> He shall summon the heaven above, and the earth, that he may judge his people. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">5</sup> Assemble ye his saints to him, those that have engaged in a covenant with him upon sacrifices. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">6</sup> And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge. Pause. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">7</sup> Hear, my people, and I will speak to thee, O Israel: and I will testify to thee: I am God, thy God. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">8</sup> I will not reprove thee on account of thy sacrifices; for thy whole-burnt-offerings are before me continually. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">9</sup> I will take no bullocks out of thine house, nor he-goats out of thy flocks. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">10</sup> For all the wild beasts of the thicket are mine, the cattle on the mountains, and oxen. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">11</sup> I know all the birds of the sky; and the beauty of the field is mine. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">12</sup> If I should be hungry, I will not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness of it. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">13</sup> Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">14</sup> Offer to God the sacrifice of praise; and pay thy vows to the Most High. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">15</sup> And call upon me in the day of affliction; and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
