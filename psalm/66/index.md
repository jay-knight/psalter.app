# Psalm 66

<sup>1</sup> For the end, a Psalm of David among the Hymns. <sup>2</sup> God be merciful to us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us. Pause. <sup>3</sup> That men may know thy way on the earth, thy salvation among all nations. <sup>4</sup> Let the nations, O God, give thanks to thee; let all the nations give thanks to thee. <sup>5</sup> Let the nations rejoice and exult, for thou shalt judge the peoples in equity, and shalt guide the nations on the earth. Pause. <sup>6</sup> Let the peoples, O God, give thanks to thee; let all the peoples give thanks to thee. <sup>7</sup> The earth has yielded her fruit; let God, our God, bless us. <sup>8</sup> Let God bless us; and let all the ends of the earth fear him.
