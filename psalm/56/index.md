<div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">1</sup> For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial, when he fled from the presence of Saul to the cave. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">2</sup> Have mercy, upon me, O God, have mercy upon me: for my soul has trusted in thee: and in the shadow of thy wings will I hope, until the iniquity have passed away. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">3</sup> I will cry to God most high; the God who has benefited me. Pause. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">4</sup> He sent from heaven and saved me; he gave to reproach them that trampled on me: God has sent forth his mercy and his truth; </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">5</sup> and he has delivered my soul from the midst of lions' whelps: I lay down to sleep, though troubled. As for the sons of men, their teeth are arms and missile weapons, and their tongue a sharp sword. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">6</sup> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and thy glory above all the earth. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">7</sup> They have prepared snares for my feet, and have bowed down my soul: they have dug a pit before my face, and fallen into it themselves.
