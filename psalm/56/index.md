# Psalm 56

<sup>1</sup> For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial, when he fled from the presence of Saul to the cave. <sup>2</sup> Have mercy, upon me, O God, have mercy upon me: for my soul has trusted in thee: and in the shadow of thy wings will I hope, until the iniquity have passed away. <sup>3</sup> I will cry to God most high; the God who has benefited me. Pause. <sup>4</sup> He sent from heaven and saved me; he gave to reproach them that trampled on me: God has sent forth his mercy and his truth; <sup>5</sup> and he has delivered my soul from the midst of lions' whelps: I lay down to sleep, though troubled. As for the sons of men, their teeth are arms and missile weapons, and their tongue a sharp sword. <sup>6</sup> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and thy glory above all the earth. <sup>7</sup> They have prepared snares for my feet, and have bowed down my soul: they have dug a pit before my face, and fallen into it themselves. Pause. <sup>8</sup> My heart, O God, is ready, my heart is ready: I will sing, yea will sing psalms. <sup>9</sup> Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I will awake early. <sup>10</sup> O Lord, I will give thanks to thee among the nations: I will sing to thee among the Gentiles. <sup>11</sup> For thy mercy has been magnified even to the heavens, and thy truth to the clouds. <sup>12</sup> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and thy glory above all the earth.
