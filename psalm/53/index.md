# Psalm 53

<sup>1</sup> For the end, among the Hymns of instruction by David, <sup>2</sup> when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Lo, is not David hid with us? <sup>3</sup> Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy might. <sup>4</sup> O God, hear my prayer; hearken to the words of my mouth. <sup>5</sup> For strangers have risen up against me, and mighty men have sought my life: they have not set God before them. Pause. <sup>6</sup> For lo! God assists me; and the Lord is the helper of my soul. <sup>7</sup> He shall return evil to mine enemies; utterly destroy them in thy truth. <sup>8</sup> I will willingly sacrifice to thee: I will give thanks to thy name, O Lord; for it is good. <sup>9</sup> For thou hast delivered me out of all affliction, and mine eye has seen my desire upon mine enemies.
