# Psalm 61

<sup>1</sup> For the end, a Psalm of David for Idithun. <sup>2</sup> Shall not my soul be subjected to God? for of him is my salvation. <sup>3</sup> For he is my God and my Saviour; my helper, I shall not be moved very much. <sup>4</sup> How long will ye assault a man? ye are all slaughtering as with a bowed wall and a broken hedge. <sup>5</sup> They only took counsel to set at nought mine honour: I ran in thirst: with their mouth they blessed, but with their heart they cursed. Pause. <sup>6</sup> Nevertheless do thou, my soul, be subjected to God; for of him is my patient hope. <sup>7</sup> For he is my God and my Saviour; my helper, I shall not be moved. <sup>8</sup> In God is my salvation and my glory: he is the God of my help, and my hope is in God. <sup>9</sup> Hope in him, all ye congregation of the people; pour out your hearts before him, for God is our helper. Pause. <sup>10</sup> But the sons of men are vain; the sons of men are false, so as to be deceitful in the balances; they are all alike formed out of vanity. <sup>11</sup> Trust not in unrighteousness, and lust not after robberies: if wealth should flow in, set not your heart upon it. <sup>12</sup> God has spoken once, and I have heard these two things, that power is of God; <sup>13</sup> and mercy is thine, O Lord; for thou wilt recompense every one according to his works.
