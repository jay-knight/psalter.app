# Psalm 28

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David on the occasion of the solemn assembly of the Tabernacle. Bring to the Lord, ye sons of God, bring to the Lord young rams; bring to the Lord glory and honour. <sup>2</sup> Bring to the Lord glory, due to his name; worship the Lord in his holy court. <sup>3</sup> The voice of the Lord is upon the waters: the God of glory has thundered: the Lord is upon many waters. <sup>4</sup> The voice of the Lord is mighty; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty. <sup>5</sup> There is the voice of the Lord who breaks the cedars; the Lord will break the cedars of Libanus. <sup>6</sup> And he will beat them small, even Libanus itself, like a calf; and the beloved one is as a young unicorn. <sup>7</sup> There is a voice of the Lord who divides a flame of fire. <sup>8</sup> A voice of the Lord who shakes the wilderness; the Lord will shake the wilderness of Cades. <sup>9</sup> The voice of the Lord strengthens the hinds, and will uncover the thickets: and in his temple every one speaks of his glory. <sup>10</sup> The Lord will dwell on the waterflood: and the Lord will sit a king for ever. <sup>11</sup> The Lord will give strength to his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.
