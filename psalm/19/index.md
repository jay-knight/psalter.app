# Psalm 19

<sup>1</sup> For the end, a Psalm of David. <sup>2</sup> The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee. <sup>3</sup> Send thee help from the sanctuary, and aid thee out of Sion. <sup>4</sup> Remember all thy sacrifice, and enrich thy whole-burnt-offering. Pause. <sup>5</sup> Grant thee according to thy heart, and fulfil all thy desire. <sup>6</sup> We will exult in thy salvation, and in the name of our God shall we be magnified: the Lord fulfil all thy petitions. <sup>7</sup> Now I know that the Lord has saved his Christ: he shall hear him from his holy heaven: the salvation of his right hand is mighty. <sup>8</sup> Some glory in chariots, and some in horses: but we will glory in the name of the Lord our God. <sup>9</sup> They are overthrown and fallen: but we are risen, and have been set upright. <sup>10</sup> O Lord, save the king: and hear us in whatever day we call upon thee.
