# Psalm 114

<sup>1</sup> Alleluia. I am well pleased, because the Lord will hearken to the voice of my supplication. <sup>2</sup> Because he has inclined his ear to me, therefore will I call upon him while I live. <sup>3</sup> The pangs of death compassed me; the dangers of hell found me: I found affliction and sorrow. <sup>4</sup> Then I called on the name of the Lord: O Lord, deliver my soul. <sup>5</sup> The Lord is merciful and righteous; yea, our God has pity. <sup>6</sup> The Lord preserves the simple: I was brought low, and he delivered me. <sup>7</sup> Return to thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord has dealt bountifully with thee. <sup>8</sup> For he has delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. <sup>9</sup> I shall be well-pleasing before the Lord in the land of the living.
