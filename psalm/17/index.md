<div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">1</sup> For the end, a Psalm of David the servant of the Lord; the words which he spoke to the Lord, even the words of this Song, in the day in which the Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul: and he said: </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">2</sup> I will love thee, O Lord, my strength. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">3</sup> The Lord is my firm support, and my refuge, and my deliverer; my God is my helper, I will hope in him; he is my defender, and the horn of my salvation, and my helper. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">4</sup> I will call upon the Lord with praises, and I shall be saved from mine enemies. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">5</sup> The pangs of death compassed me, and the torrents of ungodliness troubled me exceedingly. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">6</sup> The pangs of hell came round about me: the snares of death prevented me. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">7</sup> And when I was afflicted I called upon the Lord, and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of his holy temple, and my cry shall enter before him, even into his ears. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">8</sup> Then the earth shook and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains were disturbed, and were shaken, because God was angry with them. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">9</sup> There went up a smoke in his wrath, and fire burst into a flame at his presence: coals were kindled at it. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">10</sup> And he bowed the heaven, and came down: and thick darkness was under his feet. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">11</sup> And he mounted on cherubs and flew: he flew on the wings of winds. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">12</sup> And he made darkness his secret place: round about him was his tabernacle, even dark water in the clouds of the air. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">13</sup> At the brightness before him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">14</sup> The Lord also thundered from heaven, and the Highest uttered his voice. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">15</sup> And he sent forth his weapons, and scattered them; and multiplied lightnings, and routed them. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">16</sup> And the springs of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed, at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blasting of the breath of thy wrath. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">17</sup> He sent from on high and took me, he drew me to himself out of many waters. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">18</sup> He will deliver me from my mighty enemies, and from them that hate me; for they are stronger than I. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">19</sup> They prevented me in the day of mine affliction: but the Lord was my stay against them. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">20</sup> And he brought me out into a wide place: he will deliver me, because he has pleasure in me. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">21</sup> And the Lord will recompense me according to my righteousness; even according to the purity of my hands will he recompense me. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">22</sup> For I have kept the ways of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">23</sup> For all his judgments were before me, and his ordinances departed not from me. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">24</sup> And I shall be blameless with him, and shall keep myself from mine iniquity. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">25</sup> And the Lord shall recompense me according to my righteousness, and according to the purity of my hands before his eyes. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">26</sup> With the holy thou wilt be holy; and with the innocent man thou wilt be innocent. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">27</sup> And with the excellent man thou wilt be excellent; and with the perverse thou wilt shew frowardness. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">28</sup> For thou wilt save the lowly people, and wilt humble the eyes of the proud. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">29</sup> For thou, O Lord, wilt light my lamp: my God, thou wilt lighten my darkness. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">30</sup> For by thee shall I be delivered from a troop; and by my God I will pass over a wall. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">31</sup> As for my God, his way is perfect: the oracles of the Lord are tried in the fire; he is a protector of all them that hope in him. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">32</sup> For who is God but the Lord? and who is a God except our God? </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">33</sup> It is God that girds me with strength, and has made my way blameless: </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">34</sup> who strengthens my feet as hart's feet, and sets me upon high places. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">35</sup> He instructs my hands for war; and thou hast made my arms as a brazen bow. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">36</sup> And thou hast made me secure in my salvation: and thy right hand has helped me, and thy correction has upheld me to the end; yea, thy correction itself shall instruct me. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">37</sup> Thou hast made room for my goings under me, and my footsteps did not fail. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">38</sup> I will pursue mine enemies, and overtake them; and I will not turn back until they are consumed. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">39</sup> I will dash them to pieces and they shall not be able to stand: they shall fall under my feet. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">40</sup> For thou hast girded me with strength for war: thou hast beaten down under me all that rose up against me. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">41</sup> And thou hast made mine enemies turn their backs before me; and thou hast destroyed them that hated me. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">42</sup> They cried, but there was no deliverer: even to the Lord, but he hearkened not to them. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">43</sup> I will grind them as the mud of the streets: and I will beat them small as dust before the wind. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">44</sup> Deliver me from the gainsayings of the people: thou shalt make me head of the Gentiles: a people whom I knew not served me, </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">45</sup> at the hearing of the ear they obeyed me: the strange children lied to me. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">46</sup> The strange children waxed old, and fell away from their paths through lameness. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">47</sup> The Lord lives; and blessed be my God; and let the God of my salvation be exalted. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">48</sup> It is God that avenges me, and has subdued the nations under me; </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">49</sup> my deliverer from angry enemies: thou shalt set me on high above them that rise up against me: thou shalt deliver me from the unrighteous man. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">50</sup> Therefore will I confess to thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles, and sing to thy name. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">51</sup> God magnifies the deliverances of his king; and deals mercifully with David his anointed, and his seed, for ever. </div>
