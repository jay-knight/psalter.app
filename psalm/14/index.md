# Psalm 14

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. O Lord, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? and who shall dwell in thy holy mountain? <sup>2</sup> He that walks blameless, and works righteousness, who speaks truth in his heart. <sup>3</sup> Who has not spoken craftily with his tongue, neither has done evil to his neighbour, nor taken up a reproach against them that dwelt nearest to him. <sup>4</sup> In his sight an evil-worker is set at nought, but he honours them that fear the Lord. He swears to his neighbour, and disappoints him not. <sup>5</sup> He has not lent his money on usury, and has not received bribes against the innocent. He that does these things shall never be moved.
