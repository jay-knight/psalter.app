O Lord, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? and who shall dwell in thy holy mountain? </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">2</sup> He that walks blameless, and works righteousness, who speaks truth in his heart. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">3</sup> Who has not spoken craftily with his tongue, neither has done evil to his neighbour, nor taken up a reproach against them that dwelt nearest to him. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">4</sup> In his sight an evil-worker is set at nought, but he honours them that fear the Lord. He swears to his neighbour, and disappoints him not. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">5</sup> He has not lent his money on usury, and has not received bribes against the innocent. He that does these things shall never be moved. </div>
