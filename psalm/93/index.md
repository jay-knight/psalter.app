<div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">1</sup> A Psalm of David for the fourth day of the week. The Lord is a God of vengeance; the God of vengeance has declared himself. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">2</sup> Be thou exalted, thou that judgest the earth: render a reward to the proud. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">3</sup> How long shall sinners, O Lord, how long shall sinners boast? </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">4</sup> They will utter and speak unrighteousness; all the workers of iniquity will speak so. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">5</sup> They have afflicted thy people, O Lord, and hurt thine heritage. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">6</sup> They have slain the widow and fatherless, and murdered the stranger. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">7</sup> And they said, The Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob understand. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">8</sup> Understand now, ye simple among the people; and ye fools, at length be wise. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">9</sup> He that planted the ear, does he not hear? or he that formed the eye, does not he perceive? </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">10</sup> He that chastises the heathen, shall not he punish, even he that teaches man knowledge? </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">11</sup> The Lord knows the thoughts of men, that they are vain. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">12</sup> Blessed is the man whomsoever thou shalt chasten, O Lord, and shalt teach him out of thy law; </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">13</sup> to give him rest from evil days, until a pit be digged for the sinful one. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">14</sup> For the Lord will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance; </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">15</sup> until righteousness return to judgment, and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
