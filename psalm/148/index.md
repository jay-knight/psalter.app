# Psalm 148

<sup>1</sup> Alleluia, a Psalm of Agg√¶us and Zacharias. Praise ye the Lord from the heavens: praise him in the highest. <sup>2</sup> Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts. <sup>3</sup> Praise him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars and light. <sup>4</sup> Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and the water that is above the heavens. <sup>5</sup> Let them praise the name of the Lord: for he spoke, and they were made; he commanded, and they were created. <sup>6</sup> He has established them for ever, even for ever and ever: he has made an ordinance, and it shall not pass away. <sup>7</sup> Praise the Lord from the earth, ye serpents, and all deeps. <sup>8</sup> Fire, hail, snow, ice, stormy wind; the things that perform his word. <sup>9</sup> Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars: <sup>10</sup> wild beasts, and all cattle; reptiles, and winged birds: <sup>11</sup> kings of the earth, and all peoples; princes, and all judges of the earth: <sup>12</sup> young men and virgins, old men with youths: <sup>13</sup> let them praise the name of the Lord: for his name only is exalted; his praise is above the earth and heaven, <sup>14</sup> and he shall exalt the horn of his people, there is a hymn for all his saints, even of the children of Israel, a people who draw near to him.
