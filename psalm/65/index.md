Shout unto God, all the earth. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">2</sup> O sing praises to his name; give glory to his praise. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">3</sup> Say unto God, How awful are thy works! through the greatness of thy power thine enemies shall lie to thee. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">4</sup> Let all the earth worship thee, and sing to thee; let them sing to thy name. Pause. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">5</sup> Come and behold the works of God; he is terrible in his counsels beyond the children of men. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">6</sup> Who turns the sea into dry land; they shall go through the river on foot; there shall we rejoice in him, </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">7</sup> who by his power is Lord over the age, his eyes look upon the nations; let not them that provoke him be exalted in themselves. Pause. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">8</sup> Bless our God, ye Gentiles, and make the voice of his praise to be heard; </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">9</sup> who quickens my soul in life, and does not suffer my feet to be moved. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">10</sup> For thou, O God, hast proved us; thou hast tried us with fire as silver is tried. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">11</sup> Thou broughtest us into the snare; thou laidest afflictions on our back. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">12</sup> Thou didst mount men upon our heads; we went through fire and water; but thou broughtest us out into a place of refreshment. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">13</sup> I will go into thine house with whole-burnt-offerings; I will pay thee my vows, </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">14</sup> which my lips framed, and my mouth uttered in my affliction. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">15</sup> I will offer to thee whole-burnt-sacrifices full of marrow, with incense and rams; I will sacrifice to thee oxen with goats. Pause. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">16</sup> Come, hear, and I will tell, all ye that fear God, how great things he has done for my soul. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">17</sup> I cried to him with my mouth, and exalted him with my tongue. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">18</sup> If I have regarded iniquity in my heart, let not the Lord hearken to me. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">19</sup> Therefore God has hearkened to me; he has attended to the voice of my prayer. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">20</sup> Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me. </div>
