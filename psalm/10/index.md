# Psalm 10

<sup>1</sup> For the end, a Psalm of David. In the Lord I have put my trust: how will ye say to my soul, Flee to the mountains as a sparrow? <sup>2</sup> For behold the sinners have bent their bow, they have prepared their arrows for the quiver, to shoot privily at the upright in heart. <sup>3</sup> For they have pulled down what thou didst frame, but what has the righteous done? <sup>4</sup> The Lord is in his holy temple, as for the Lord, his throne is in heaven: his eyes look upon the poor, his eyelids try the sons of men. <sup>5</sup> The Lord tries the righteous and the ungodly: and he that loves unrighteousness hates his own soul. <sup>6</sup> He shall rain upon sinners snares, fire, and brimstone, and a stormy blast shall be the portion of their cup. <sup>7</sup> For the Lord is righteous, and loves righteousness; his face beholds uprightness.
