# Psalm 132

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Degrees. See now! what is so good, or what so pleasant, as for brethren to dwell together? <sup>2</sup> It is as ointment on the head, that ran down to the beard, even the beard of Aaron; that ran down to the fringe of his clothing. <sup>3</sup> As the dew of Aermon, that comes down on the mountains of Sion: for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for ever.
