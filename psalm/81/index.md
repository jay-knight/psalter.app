# Psalm 81

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm for Asaph. God stands in the assembly of gods; and in the midst of them will judge gods. <sup>2</sup> How long will ye judge unrighteously, and accept the persons of sinners? Pause. <sup>3</sup> Judge the orphan and poor: do justice to the low and needy. <sup>4</sup> Rescue the needy, and deliver the poor out of the hand of the sinner. <sup>5</sup> They know not, nor understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth shall be shaken. <sup>6</sup> I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you children of the Most High. <sup>7</sup> But ye die as men, and fall as one of the princes. <sup>8</sup> Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
