# Psalm 124

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Degrees. They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Sion: he that dwells in Jerusalem shall never be moved. <sup>2</sup> The mountains are round about her, and so the Lord is round about his people, from henceforth and even for ever. <sup>3</sup> For the Lord will not allow the rod of sinners to be upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous should stretch forth their hands to iniquity. <sup>4</sup> Do good, O Lord, to them that are good, and to them that are upright in heart. <sup>5</sup> But them that turn aside to crooked ways the Lord will lead away with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.
