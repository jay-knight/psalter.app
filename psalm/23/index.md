# Psalm 23

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm for David on the first day of the week. The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof; the world, and all that dwell in it. <sup>2</sup> He has founded it upon the seas, and prepared it upon the rivers. <sup>3</sup> Who shall go up to the mountain of the Lord, and who shall stand in his holy place? <sup>4</sup> He that is innocent in his hands and pure in his heart; who has not lifted up his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour. <sup>5</sup> He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his Saviour. <sup>6</sup> This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek the face of the God of Jacob. Pause. <sup>7</sup> Lift up your gates, ye princes, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; and the king of glory shall come in. <sup>8</sup> Who is this king of glory? the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. <sup>9</sup> Lift up your gates, ye princes; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the king of glory shall come in. <sup>10</sup> Who is this king of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is this king of glory.
