# Psalm 129

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Degrees. Out of the depths have I cried to thee, O Lord. <sup>2</sup> O Lord, hearken to my voice; let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication. <sup>3</sup> If thou, O Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? <sup>4</sup> For with thee is forgiveness: for thy name's sake <sup>5</sup> have I waited for thee, O Lord, my soul has waited for thy word. <sup>6</sup> My soul has hoped in the Lord; from the morning watch till night. <sup>7</sup> Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption. <sup>8</sup> And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
