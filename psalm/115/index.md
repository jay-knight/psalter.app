# Psalm 115

<sup>1</sup> Alleluia. I believed, wherefore I have spoken: but I was greatly afflicted. <sup>2</sup> And I said in mine amazement, Every man is a liar. <sup>3</sup> What shall I render to the Lord for all the things wherein he has rewarded me? <sup>4</sup> I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. <sup>4a</sup> I will pay my vows to the Lord, in the presence of all his people. <sup>6</sup> Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. <sup>7</sup> O Lord, I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast burst my bonds asunder. <sup>8</sup> I will offer to thee the sacrifice of praise, and will call upon the name of the Lord. <sup>9</sup> I will pay my vows unto the Lord, in the presence of all his people, <sup>10</sup> in the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, Jerusalem.
