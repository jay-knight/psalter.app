<div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">1</sup> For the end, a Psalm of David. O God, pass not over my praise in silence; </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">2</sup> for the mouth of the sinner and the mouth of the crafty man have been opened against me: they have spoken against me with a crafty tongue. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">3</sup> And they have compassed me with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">4</sup> Instead of loving me, they falsely accused me: but I continued to pray. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">5</sup> And they rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">6</sup> Set thou a sinner against him; and let the devil stand at his right hand. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">7</sup> When he is judged, let him go forth condemned: and let his prayer become sin. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">8</sup> Let his days be few: and let another take his office of overseer. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">9</sup> Let his children be orphans, and his wife a widow. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">10</sup> Let his children wander without a dwelling-place, and beg: let them be cast out of their habitations. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">11</sup> Let his creditor exact all that belongs to him: and let strangers spoil his labours. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">12</sup> Let him have no helper; neither let there be any one to have compassion on his fatherless children. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">13</sup> Let his children be given up to utter destruction: in one generation let his name be blotted out. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">14</sup> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">15</sup> Let them be before the Lord continually; and let their memorial be blotted out from the earth. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">16</sup> Because he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the needy and poor man, and that to slay him that was pricked in the heart. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">17</sup> He loved cursing also, and it shall come upon him; and he took not pleasure in blessing, so it shall be removed far from him. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">18</sup> Yea, he put on cursing as a garment, and it is come as water into his bowels, and as oil into his bones. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">19</sup> Let it be to him as a garment which he puts on, and as a girdle with which he girds himself continually. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">20</sup> This is the dealing of the Lord with those who falsely accuse me, and of them that speak evil against my soul. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">21</sup> But thou, O Lord, Lord, deal mercifully with me, for thy name's sake: for thy mercy is good. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">22</sup> Deliver me, for I am poor and needy; and my heart is troubled within me. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">23</sup> I am removed as a shadow in its going down: I am tossed up and down like locusts. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">24</sup> My knees are weakened through fasting, and my flesh is changed by reason of the want of oil. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">25</sup> I became also a reproach to them: when they saw me they shook their heads. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">26</sup> Help me, O Lord my God; and save me according to thy mercy. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">27</sup> And let them know that this is thy hand; and that thou, Lord, hast wrought it. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">28</sup> Let them curse, but thou shalt bless: let them that rise up against me be ashamed, but let thy servant rejoice. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">29</sup> Let those that falsely accuse me be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their shame as with a mantle. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">30</sup> I will give thanks to the Lord abundantly with my mouth; and in the midst of many I will praise him. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">31</sup> For he stood on the right hand of the poor, to save me from them that persecute my soul. </div>
