# Psalm 12

<sup>1</sup> For the end, a Psalm of David. <sup>2</sup> How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me? for ever? how long wilt thou turn away thy face from me? <sup>3</sup> How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrows in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy be exalted over me? <sup>4</sup> Look on me, hearken to me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep in death; <sup>5</sup> lest at any time mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: my persecutors will exult if ever I should be moved. <sup>6</sup> But I have hoped in thy mercy; my heart shall exult in thy salvation. I will sing to the Lord who has dealt bountifully with me, and I will sing psalms to the name of the Lord most high.
