# Psalm 84

<sup>1</sup> For the end, a Psalm for the sons of Core. <sup>2</sup> O Lord, thou hast taken pleasure in thy land: thou hast turned back the captivity of Jacob. <sup>3</sup> Thou hast forgiven thy people their transgressions; thou hast covered all their sins. Pause. <sup>4</sup> Thou hast caused all thy wrath to cease: thou hast turned from thy fierce anger. <sup>5</sup> Turn us, O God of our salvation, and turn thine anger away from us. <sup>6</sup> Wouldest thou be angry with us for ever? or wilt thou continue thy wrath from generation to generation? <sup>7</sup> O God, thou wilt turn and quicken us; and thy people shall rejoice in thee. <sup>8</sup> Shew us thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation. <sup>9</sup> I will hear what the Lord God will say concerning me: for he shall speak peace to his people, and to his saints, and to those that turn their heart toward him. <sup>10</sup> Moreover his salvation is near them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land. <sup>11</sup> Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed each other. <sup>12</sup> Truth has sprung out of the earth; and righteousness has looked down from heaven. <sup>13</sup> For the Lord will give goodness; and our land shall yield her fruit. <sup>14</sup> Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set his steps in the way.
