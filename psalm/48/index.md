<div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">1</sup> For the end, a Psalm for the sons of Core. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">2</sup> Hear these words, all ye nations, hearken, all ye that dwell upon the earth: </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">3</sup> both the sons of mean men, and sons of great men; the rich and poor man together. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">4</sup> My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall bring forth understanding. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">5</sup> I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my riddle on the harp. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">6</sup> Wherefore should I fear in the evil day? the iniquity of my heel shall compass me. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">7</sup> They that trust in their strength, and boast themselves in the multitude of their wealthâ€” </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">8</sup> A brother does not redeem, shall a man redeem? he shall not give to God a ransom for himself, </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">9</sup> or the price of the redemption of his soul, though he labour for ever, </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">10</sup> and live to the end, so that he should not see corruption. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">11</sup> When he shall see wise men dying, the fool and the senseless one shall perish together; and they shall leave their wealth to strangers. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">12</sup> And their sepulchres are their houses for ever, even their tabernacles to all generations: they have called their lands after their own names. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">13</sup> And man being in honour, understands not: he is compared to the senseless cattle, and is like to them. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">14</sup> This their way is an offence to them: yet afterwards men will commend their sayings. Pause. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">15</sup> They have laid them as sheep in Hades; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning, and their help shall fail in Hades from their glory. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">16</sup> But God shall deliver my soul from the power of Hades, when he shall receive me. Pause. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">17</sup> Fear not when a man is enriched, and when the glory of his house is increased. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">18</sup> For he shall take nothing when he dies; neither shall his glory descend with him. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">19</sup> For his soul shall be blessed in his life: he shall give thanks to thee when thou dost well to him. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">20</sup> Yet he shall go in to the generation of his fathers; he shall never see light. </div><div class="psalm-verse"><sup class="verse-number">21</sup> Man that is in honour, understands not: he is compared to the senseless cattle, and is like them. </div>
