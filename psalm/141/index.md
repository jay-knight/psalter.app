# Psalm 141

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of instruction for David, when he was in the cave,â€”a Prayer. <sup>2</sup> I cried to the Lord with my voice; with my voice I made supplication to the Lord. <sup>3</sup> I will pour out before him my supplication: I will declare before him mine affliction. <sup>4</sup> When my spirit was fainting within me, then thou knewest my paths; in the very way wherein I was walking, they hid a snare for me. <sup>5</sup> I looked on my right hand, and behold, for there was none that noticed me; refuge failed me; and there was none that cared for my soul. <sup>6</sup> I cried unto thee, O Lord, and said, Thou art my hope, my portion in the land of the living. <sup>7</sup> Attend to my supplication, for I am brought very low; deliver me from them that persecute me; for they are stronger than I. <sup>8</sup> Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks to thy name, O Lord; the righteous shall wait for me, until thou recompense me.
