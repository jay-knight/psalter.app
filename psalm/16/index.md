# Psalm 16

<sup>1</sup> A Prayer of David. Hearken, O Lord of my righteousness, attend to my petition; give ear to my prayer not uttered with deceitful lips. <sup>2</sup> Let my judgment come forth from thy presence; let mine eyes behold righteousness. <sup>3</sup> Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me by night; thou hast tried me as with fire, and unrighteousness has not been found in me: I am purposed that my mouth shall not speak amiss. <sup>4</sup> As for the works of men, by the words of thy lips I have guarded myself from hard ways. <sup>5</sup> Direct my steps in thy paths, that my steps slip not. <sup>6</sup> I have cried, for thou heardest me, O God: incline thine ear to me, and hearken to my words. <sup>7</sup> Shew the marvels of thy mercies, thou that savest them that hope in thee. <sup>8</sup> Keep me as the apple of the eye from those that resist thy right hand: thou shalt screen me by the covering of thy wings, <sup>9</sup> from the face of the ungodly that have afflicted me: mine enemies have compassed about my soul. <sup>10</sup> They have enclosed themselves with their own fat: their mouth has spoken pride. <sup>11</sup> They have now cast me out and compassed me round about: they have set their eyes so as to bow them down to the ground. <sup>12</sup> They laid wait for me as a lion ready for prey, and like a lion's whelp dwelling in secret places. <sup>13</sup> Arise, O Lord, prevent them, and cast them down: deliver my soul from the ungodly: draw thy sword, <sup>14</sup> because of the enemies of thine hand: O Lord, destroy them from the earth; scatter them in their life, though their belly has been filled with thy hidden treasures: they have been satisfied with uncleanness, and have left the remnant of their possessions to their babes. <sup>15</sup> But I shall appear in righteousness before thy face: I shall be satisfied when thy glory appears.
